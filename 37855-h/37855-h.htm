<h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>


<p>Unity is perhaps the keynote of modern science.
This means unity in time, for the present is but
the outgrowth of the past, and the future of the
present. It means unity of process, for there seems to be
no sharp dividing line between organic and inorganic,
physical and mental, mental and spiritual. And the unity
of modern science means also a growing tendency toward
co&ouml;peration, so that by working together scientists discover
much that would else have remained hid.</p>

<p>This book illustrates the modern trend toward unity in
all of these ways. First, it is a companion volume to
<em>Earth and Sun</em>. That volume is a discussion of the causes
of weather, but a consideration of the weather of the
present almost inevitably leads to a study of the climate
of the past. Hence the two books were written originally
as one, and were only separated from considerations of
convenience. Second, the unity of nature is so great that
when a subject such as climatic changes is considered, it
is almost impossible to avoid other subjects, such as the
movements of the earth's crust. Hence this book not only
discusses climatic changes, but considers the causes of
earthquakes and attempts to show how climatic changes
may be related to great geological revolutions in the
form, location, and altitude of the lands. Thus the book
has a direct bearing on all the main physical factors
which have molded the evolution of organic life, including
man.</p>
<!--File: cc018.png-->
<p>In the third place, this volume illustrates the unity of
modern science because it is pre&euml;minently a co&ouml;perative
product. Not only have the two authors shared in its
production, but several of the Yale Faculty have also
co&ouml;perated. From the geological standpoint, Professor
Charles Schuchert has read the entire manuscript in its
final form as well as parts at various stages. He has
helped not only by criticisms, suggestions, and facts, but
by paragraphs ready for the printer. In the same way
in the domain of physics, Professor Leigh Page has repeatedly
taken time to assist, and either in writing or by
word of mouth has contributed many pages. In astronomy,
the same cordial co&ouml;peration has come with equal
readiness from Professor Frank Schlesinger. Professors
Schuchert, Schlesinger, and Page have contributed so
materially that they are almost co-authors of the volume.
In mathematics, Professor Ernest W. Brown has been
similarly helpful, having read and criticised the entire
book. In certain chemical problems, Professor Harry W.
Foote has been our main reliance. The advice and suggestions
of these men have frequently prevented errors, and
have again and again started new and profitable lines of
thought. If we have made mistakes, it has been because
we have not profited sufficiently by their co&ouml;peration. If
the main hypothesis of this book proves sound, it is
largely because it has been built up in constant consultation
with men who look at the problem from different
points of vision. Our appreciation of their generous and
unstinted co&ouml;peration is much deeper than would appear
from this brief paragraph.</p>

<p>Outside the Yale Faculty we have received equally
cordial assistance. Professor T. C. Chamberlin of the University
of Chicago, to whom, with his permission, we take
great pleasure in dedicating this volume, has read the
<!--File: cc019.png-->
entire proof and has made many helpful suggestions.
We cannot speak too warmly of our appreciation not
only of this, but of the way his work has served for years
as an inspiration in the preliminary work of gathering
data for this volume. Professor Harlow Shapley of Harvard
University has contributed materially to the chapter
on the sun and its journey through space; Professor
Andrew E. Douglass of the University of Arizona has
put at our disposal some of his unpublished results;
Professors S. B. Woodworth and Reginald A. Daly, and
Mr. Robert W. Sayles of Harvard, and Professor Henry
F. Reid of Johns Hopkins have suggested new facts and
sources of information; Professor E. R. Cumings of
Indiana University has critically read the entire proof;
conversations with Professor John P. Buwalda of the
University of California while he was teaching at Yale
make him another real contributor; and Mr. Wayland
Williams has contributed the interesting quotation from
Bacon on page x of this book. Miss Edith S. Russell has
taken great pains in preparing the manuscript and in
suggesting many changes that make for clearness. Many
others have also helped, but it is impossible to make due
acknowledgment because such contributions have become
so thoroughly a part of the mental background of the
book that their source is no longer distinct in the minds
of the authors.</p>

<p>The division of labor between the two authors has not
followed any set rules. Both have had a hand in all parts
of the book. The main draft of Chapters VII, VIII, IX,
XI, and XIII was written by the junior author; his contributions
are also especially numerous in Chapters X
and XV; the rest of the book was written originally by
the senior author.</p>

<h3>THE UNIFORMITY OF CLIMATE</h3>


<p>The r&ocirc;le of climate in the life of today suggests its
importance in the past and in the future. No human
being can escape from the fact that his food,
clothing, shelter, recreation, occupation, health, and
energy are all profoundly influenced by his climatic surroundings.
A change of season brings in its train some
alteration in practically every phase of human activity.
Animals are influenced by climate even more than man,
for they have not developed artificial means of protecting
themselves. Even so hardy a creature as the dog
becomes notably different with a change of climate. The
thick-haired "husky" of the Eskimos has outwardly
little in common with the small and almost hairless
canines that grovel under foot in Mexico. Plants are even
more sensitive than animals and men. Scarcely a single
species can flourish permanently in regions which differ
more than 20&deg;C. in average yearly temperature, and for
most the limit of successful growth is 10&deg;.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup>
So far as we
yet know every living species of plant and animal, including
man, thrives best under definite and limited conditions
of temperature, humidity, and sunshine, and of the composition
and movement of the atmosphere or water in
which it lives. Any departure beyond the limits means
lessened efficiency, and in the long run a lower rate of

<!--File: cc026.png Page_2-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_2" title="pg 2"></a>

reproduction and a tendency toward changes in specific
characteristics. Any great departure means suffering or
death for the individual and destruction for the species.</p>

<p>Since climate has so profound an influence on life
today, it has presumably been equally potent at other
times. Therefore few scientific questions are more important
than how and why the earth's climate has varied
in the past, and what changes it is likely to undergo in
the future. This book sets forth what appear to be the
chief reasons for climatic variations during historic and
geologic times. It assumes that causes which can now be
observed in operation, as explained in a companion
volume entitled <em>Earth and Sun</em>, and in such books as
Humphreys' <em>Physics of the Air</em>, should be carefully
studied before less obvious causes are appealed to. It
also assumes that these same causes will continue to
operate, and are the basis of all valid predictions as to
the weather or climate of the future.</p>

<p>In our analysis of climatic variations, we may well
begin by inquiring how the earth's climate has varied
during geological history. Such an inquiry discloses three
great tendencies, which to the superficial view seem contradictory.
All, however, have a similar effect in providing
conditions under which organic evolution is able to
make progress. The first tendency is toward uniformity,
a uniformity so pronounced and of such vast duration
as to stagger the imagination. Superposed upon this
there seems to be a tendency toward complexity. During
the greater part of geological history the earth's climate
appears to have been relatively monotonous, both from
place to place and from season to season; but since the
Miocene the rule has been diversity and complexity, a
condition highly favorable to organic evolution. Finally,
the uniformity of the vast eons of the past and the

<!--File: cc027.png Page_3-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_3" title="pg 3"></a>

tendency toward complexity are broken by  pulsatory
changes, first in one direction and then in another. To
our limited human vision some of the changes, such as
glacial periods, seem to be waves of enormous proportions,
but compared with the possibilities of the universe
they are merely as the ripples made by a summer zephyr.</p>

<p>The uniformity of the earth's climate throughout the
vast stretches of geological time can best be realized by
comparing the range of temperature on the earth during
that period with the possible range as shown in the entire
solar system. As may be seen in Table 1, the geological
record opens with the Archeozoic era, or "Age of Unicellular
Life," as it is sometimes called, for the preceding
cosmic time has left no record that can yet be read.
Practically no geologists now believe that the beginning
of the Archeozoic was less than one hundred million
years ago; and since the discovery of the peculiar properties
of radium many of the best students do not hesitate
to say a billion or a billion and a half.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup>
Even in the
Archeozoic the rocks testify to a climate seemingly not
greatly different from that of the average of geologic
time. The earth's surface was then apparently cool
enough so that it was covered with oceans and warm
enough so that the water teemed with microscopic life.
The air must have been charged with water vapor and
with carbon dioxide, for otherwise there seems to be no
possible way of explaining the formation of mudstones
and sandstones, limestones of vast thickness, carbonaceous
shales, graphites, and iron ores.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">[3]</a></sup> Although the
Archeozoic has yielded no generally admitted fossils, yet
what seem to be massive alg&aelig; and sponges have been

<!--File: cc028.png Page_4-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_4" title="pg 4"></a>

found in Canada. On the other hand, abundant life is
believed to have been present in the oceans, for by no
other known means would it be possible to take from the
air the vast quantities of carbon that now form carbonaceous
shales and graphite.</p>

<p>In the next geologic era, the Proterozoic, the researches
of Walcott have shown that besides the marine
alg&aelig; there must have been many other kinds of life. The
Proterozoic fossils thus far discovered include not only
microscopic radiolarians such as still form the red ooze
of the deepest ocean floors, but the much more significant
tubes of annelids or worms. The presence of the
annelids, which are relatively high in the scale of organization,
is generally taken to mean that more lowly forms
of animals such as coelenterates and probably even the
mollusca and primitive arthropods must already have
been evolved. That there were many kinds of marine
invertebrates living in the later Proterozoic is indicated
by the highly varied life and more especially the trilobites
found in the oldest Cambrian strata of the next
succeeding period. In fact the Cambrian has sponges,
primitive corals, a great variety of brachiopods, the
beginnings of gastropods, a wonderful array of trilobites,
and other lowly forms of arthropods. Since, under the
postulate of evolution, the life of that time forms an unbroken
sequence with that of the present, and since many
of the early forms differ only in minor details from those
of today, we infer that the climate then was not very
different from that of today. The same line of reasoning
leads to the conclusion that even in the middle of the
Proterozoic, when multicellular marine animals must
already have been common, the climate of the earth had
already for an enormous period been such that all the
lower types of oceanic invertebrates had already evolved.</p>

<p>Moreover, they could live in most latitudes, for the indirect
evidences of life in the Archeozoic and Proterozoic
rocks are widely distributed. Thus it appears that
at an almost incredibly early period, perhaps many hundred
million years ago, the earth's climate differed only
a little from that of the present.</p>

<p>The extreme limits of temperature beyond which the
climate of geological times cannot have departed can be
approximately determined. Today the warmest parts of
the ocean have an average temperature of about 30&deg;C.
on the surface. Only a few forms of life live where the
average temperature is much higher than this. In deserts,
to be sure, some highly organized plants and animals can
for a short time endure a temperature as high as 75&deg;C.
(167&deg;F.). In certain hot springs, some of the lowest unicellular
plant forms exist in water which is only a little
below the boiling point. More complex forms, however,
such as sponges, worms, and all the higher plants and
animals, seem to be unable to live either in water or air
where the temperature averages above 45&deg;C. (113&deg;F.)
for any great length of time and it is doubtful whether
they can thrive permanently even at that temperature.
The obvious unity of life for hundreds of millions of
years and its presence at all times in middle latitudes so
far as we can tell seem to indicate that since the beginning
of marine life the temperature of the oceans
cannot have averaged much above 50&deg;C. even in the
warmest portions. This is putting the limit too high
rather than too low, but even so the warmest parts of
the earth can scarcely have averaged much more than
20&deg; warmer than at present.</p>

<p>Turning to the other extreme, we may inquire how
much colder than now the earth's surface may have been
since life first appeared. Proterozoic fossils have been

<!--File: cc031.png Page _7-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_7" title="pg 7"></a>

found in places where the present average temperature
approaches 0&deg;C. If those places should be colder than
now by 30&deg;C., or more, the drop in temperature at the
equator would almost certainly be still greater, and the
seas everywhere would be permanently frozen. Thus
life would be impossible. Since the contrasts between
summer and winter, and between the poles and the
equator seem generally to have been less in the past than
at present, the range through which the mean temperature
of the earth as a whole could vary without utterly
destroying life was apparently less than would now be
the case.</p>

<p>These considerations make it fairly certain that for at
least several hundred million years the average temperature
of the earth's surface has never varied more than
perhaps 30&deg;C. above or below the present level. Even this
range of 60&deg;C. (108&deg;F.) may be double or triple the range
that has actually occurred. That the temperature has not
passed beyond certain narrow limits, whatever their
exact degree, is clear from the fact that if it had done so,
all the higher forms of life would have been destroyed.
Certain of the lowest unicellular forms might indeed have
persisted, for when dormant they can stand great extremes
of dry heat and of cold for a long time. Even
so, evolution would have had to begin almost anew. The
supposition that such a thing has happened is untenable,
for there is no hint of any complete break in the record
of life during geological times,&mdash;no sudden disappearance
of the higher organisms followed by a long period
with no signs of life other than indirect evidence such as
occurs in the Archeozoic.</p>

<p>A change of 60&deg;C. or even of 20&deg; in the average temperature
of the earth's surface may seem large when
viewed from the limited standpoint of terrestrial experience.
<!--File: cc032.png Page_8-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_8" title="pg 8"></a>
Viewed, however, from the standpoint of
cosmic evolution, or even of the solar system, it seems
a mere trifle. Consider the possibilities. The temperature
of empty space is the absolute zero, or -273&deg;C.
To this temperature all matter must fall, provided it
exists long enough and is not appreciably heated by collisions
or by radiation. At the other extreme lies the
temperature of the stars. As stars go, our sun is only
moderately hot, but the temperature of its surface is
calculated to be nearly 7000&deg;C., while thousands of miles
in the interior it may rise to 20,000&deg; or 100,000&deg; or some
other equally unknowable and incomprehensible figure.
Between the limits of the absolute zero on the one hand,
and the interior of a sun or star on the other, there is
almost every conceivable possibility of temperature.
Today the earth's surface averages not far from 14&deg;C.,
or 287&deg; above the absolute zero. Toward the interior,
the temperature in mines and deep wells rises about 1&deg;C.
for every 100 meters. At this rate it would be over 500&deg;C.
at a depth of ten miles, and over 5000&deg; at 100 miles.</p>

<p>Let us confine ourselves to surface temperatures,
which are all that concern us in discussing climate. It
has been calculated by Poynting<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5">[5]</a></sup> that if a small sphere
absorbed and re-radiated all the heat that fell upon it,
its temperature at the distance of Mercury from the sun
would average about 210&deg;C.; at the distance of Venus,
85&deg;; the earth 27&deg;; Mars -30&deg;; Neptune 219&deg;. A planet
much nearer the sun than is Mercury might be heated to
a temperature of a thousand, or even several thousand,
degrees, while one beyond Neptune would remain almost
at absolute zero. It is well within the range of possibility
that the temperature of a planet's surface should be
<!--File: cc033.png Page 9-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_9" title="pg 9"></a>
anywhere from near -273&deg;C. up to perhaps 5000&deg;C. or
more, although the probability of low temperature is
much greater than of high. Thus throughout the whole
vast range of possibilities extending to perhaps 10,000&deg;,
the earth claims only 60&deg; at most, or less than 1 per cent.
This may be remarkable, but what is far more remarkable
is that the earth's range of 60&deg; includes what seem
to be the two most critical of all possible temperatures,
namely, the freezing point of water, 0&deg;C., and the temperature
where water can dissolve an amount of carbon
dioxide equal to its own volume. The most remarkable
fact of all is that the earth has preserved its temperature
within these narrow limits for a hundred million years,
or perchance a thousand million.</p>

<p>To appreciate the extraordinary significance of this
last fact, it is necessary to realize how extremely critical
are the temperatures from about 0&deg; to 40&deg;C., and how
difficult it is to find any good reason for a relatively
uniform temperature through hundreds of millions of
years. Since the dawn of geological time the earth's
temperature has apparently always included the range
from about the freezing point of water up to about the
point where protoplasm begins to disintegrate. Henderson,
in <em>The Fitness of the Environment</em>, rightly says that
water is "the most familiar and the most important of
all things." In many respects water and carbon dioxide
form the most unique pair of substances in the whole
realm of chemistry. Water has a greater tendency than
any other known substance to remain within certain
narrowly defined limits of temperature. Not only does it
have a high specific heat, so that much heat is needed to
raise its temperature, but on freezing it gives up more
heat than any substance except ammonia, while none of
the common liquids approach it in the amount of additional
<!--File: cc034.png Page_10-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_10" title="pg 10"></a>
heat required for conversion into vapor after the
temperature of vaporization has been reached. Again,
water substance, as the physicists call all forms of H<sub>2</sub>O,
is unique in that it not only contracts on melting, but
continues to contract until a temperature several degrees
above its melting point is reached. That fact has a vast
importance in helping to keep the earth's surface at a
uniform temperature. If water were like most liquids,
the bottoms of all the oceans and even the entire body of
water in most cases would be permanently frozen.</p>

<p>Again, as a solvent there is literally nothing to compare
with water. As Henderson<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6">[6]</a></sup> puts it: "Nearly the
whole science of chemistry has been built up around
water and aqueous solution." One of the most significant
evidences of this is the variety of elements whose presence
can be detected in sea water. According to Henderson
they include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon,
chlorine, sodium, magnesium, sulphur, phosphorus, which
are easily detected; and also arsenic, c&aelig;sium, gold,
lithium, rubidium, barium, lead, boron, fluorine, iron,
iodine, bromine, potassium, cobalt, copper, manganese,
nickel, silver, silicon, zinc, aluminium, calcium, and
strontium. Yet in spite of its marvelous power of solution,
water is chemically rather inert and relatively
stable. It dissolves all these elements and thousands of
their compounds, but still remains water and can easily
be separated and purified. Another unique property of
water is its power of ionizing dissolved substances, a
property which makes it possible to produce electric
currents in batteries. This leads to an almost infinite
array of electro-chemical reactions which play an almost
dominant r&ocirc;le in the processes of life. Finally, no
common liquid except mercury equals water in its power
<!--File: cc035.png Page_11-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_11" title="pg 11"></a>
of capillarity. This fact is of enormous moment in
biology, most obviously in respect to the soil.</p>

<p>Although carbon dioxide is far less familiar than
water, it is almost as important. "These two simple substances,"
says Henderson, "are the common source of
every one of the complicated substances which are produced
by living beings, and they are the common end
products of the wearing away of all the constituents of
protoplasm, and of the destruction of those materials
which yield energy to the body." One of the remarkable
physical properties of carbon dioxide is its degree of
solubility in water. This quality varies enormously in
different substances. For example, at ordinary pressures
and temperatures, water can absorb only about 5 per
cent of its own volume of oxygen, while it can take up
about 1300 times its own volume of ammonia. Now for
carbon dioxide, unlike most gases, the volume that can
be absorbed by water is nearly the same as the volume
of the water. The volumes vary, however, according to
temperature, being absolutely the same at a temperature
of about 15&deg;C. or 59&deg;F., which is close to the ideal temperature
for man's physical health and practically the
same as the mean temperature of the earth's surface
when all seasons are averaged together. "Hence, when
water is in contact with air, and equilibrium has been
established, the amount of free carbonic acid in a given
volume of water is almost exactly equal to the amount
in the adjacent air. Unlike oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen,
carbonic acid enters water freely; unlike sulphurous
oxide and ammonia, it escapes freely from water. Thus
the waters can never wash carbonic acid completely out
of the air, nor can the air keep it from the waters. It is
the one substance which thus, in considerable quantities
relative to its total amount, everywhere accompanies
<!--File: cc036.png Page_12-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_12" title="pg 12"></a>
water. In earth, air, fire, and water alike these two substances
are always associated.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, if water be the first primary constituent
of the environment, carbonic acid is inevitably
the second,&mdash;because of its solubility possessing an
equal mobility with water, because of the reservoir of the
atmosphere never to be depleted by chemical action in
the oceans, lakes, and streams. In truth, so close is the
association between these two substances that it is
scarcely correct logically to separate them at all; together
they make up the real environment and they never
part company."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The complementary qualities of carbon dioxide and
water are of supreme importance because these two are
the only known substances which are able to form a vast
series of complex compounds with highly varying chemical
formul&aelig;. No other known compounds can give off
or take on atoms without being resolved back into their
elements. No others can thus change their form freely
without losing their identity. This power of change without
destruction is the fundamental chemical characteristic
of life, for life demands complexity, change, and
growth.</p>

<p>In order that water and carbon dioxide may combine
to form the compounds on which life is based, the water
must be in the liquid form, it must be able to dissolve
carbon dioxide freely, and the temperature must not be
high enough to break up the highly complex and delicate
compounds as soon as they are formed. In other words,
the temperature must be above freezing, while it must
not rise higher than some rather indefinite point between
50&deg;C. and the boiling point, where all water finally turns
into vapor. In the whole range of temperature, so far as
<!--File: cc037.png Page_13-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_13" title="pg 13"></a>
we know, there is no other interval where any such complex
reactions take place. The temperature of the earth
for hundreds of millions of years has remained firmly
fixed within these limits.</p>

<p>The astonishing quality of the earth's uniformity of
temperature becomes still more apparent when we consider
the origin of the sun's heat. What that origin is
still remains a question of dispute. The old ideas of a
burning sun, or of one that is simply losing an original
supply of heat derived from some accident, such as collision
with another body, were long ago abandoned. The
impact of a constant supply of meteors affords an almost
equally unsatisfactory explanation. Moulton<sup><a href="#fn8" id="r8">[8]</a></sup> states that
if the sun were struck by enough meteorites to keep up
its heat, the earth would almost certainly be struck by
enough so that it would receive about half of 1 per cent
as much heat from them as from the sun. This is millions
of times more heat than is now received from meteors.
If the sun owes its heat to the impact of larger bodies at
longer intervals, the geological record should show a
series of interruptions far more drastic than is actually
the case.</p>

<p>It has also been supposed that the sun owes its heat
to contraction. If a gaseous body contracts it becomes
warmer. Finally, however, it must become so dense that
its rate of contraction diminishes and the process ceases.
Under the sun's present condition of size and density a
radial contraction of 120 feet per year would be enough
to supply all the energy now radiated by that body. This
seems like a hopeful source of energy, but Kelvin calculated
that twenty million years ago it was ineffective
and ten million years hence it will be equally so. Moreover,
if this is the source of heat, the amount of radiation
<!--File: cc038.png Page_14-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_14" title="pg 14"></a>
from the sun would have to vary enormously.
Twenty million years ago the sun would have extended
nearly to the earth's orbit and would have been so tenuous
that it would have emitted no more heat than some
of the nebul&aelig; in space. Some millions of years later,
when the sun's radius was twice as great as at present,
that body would have emitted only one-fourth as much
heat as now, which would mean that on the earth's surface
the theoretical temperature would have been 200&deg;
below the present level. This is utterly out of accord with
the uniformity of climate shown by the geological record.
In the future, if the sun's contraction is the only source
of heat, the sun can supply the present amount for only
ten million years, which would mean a change utterly
unlike anything of which the geological record holds
even the faintest hint.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="r9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Altogether the problem of how the sun can have remained
so uniform and how the earth's atmosphere and
other conditions can also have remained so uniform
throughout hundreds of millions of years is one of the
most puzzling in the whole realm of nature. If appeal is
taken to radioactivity and the breaking up of uranium
into radium and helium, conditions can be postulated
which will give the required amount of energy. Such is
also the case if it be supposed that there is some unknown
process which may induce an atomic change like radioactivity
in bodies which are now supposed to be stable
elements. In either case, however, there is as yet no
satisfactory explanation of the <em>uniformity</em> of the earth's
climate. A hundred million or a thousand million years
ago the temperature of the earth's surface was very
much the same as now. The earth had then presumably
ceased to emit any great amount of heat, if we may judge
<!--File: cc039.png Page_15-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_15" title="pg 15"></a>
from the fact that its surface was cool enough so that
great ice sheets could accumulate on low lands within 40&deg;
of the equator. The atmosphere was apparently almost
like that of today, and was almost certainly not different
enough to make up for any great divergence of the sun
from its present condition. We cannot escape the stupendous
fact that in those remote times the sun must
have been essentially the same as now, or else that some
utterly unknown factor is at work.</p>

<h3>THE VARIABILITY OF CLIMATE</h3>


<p>The variability of the earth's climate is almost as
extraordinary as its uniformity. This variability
is made up partly of a long, slow tendency in one
direction and partly of innumerable cycles of every conceivable
duration from days, or even hours, up to millions
of years. Perhaps the easiest way to grasp the full complexity
of the matter is to put the chief types of climatic
sequence in the form of a table.</p>


<table id="table_2" class="borders">

<p>In assigning names to the various types an attempt
has been made to indicate something of the nature of the
sequence so far as duration, periodicity, and general
tendencies are concerned. Not even the rich English
language of the twentieth century, however, furnishes
words with enough shades of meaning to express all that
<!--File: cc041.png Page 17-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_17" title="pg 17"></a>
is desired. Moreover, except in degree, there is no sharp
distinction between some of the related types, such as
glacial fluctuations and historic pulsations. Yet, taken as
a whole, the table brings out the great contrast between
two absolutely diverse extremes. At the one end lies well-nigh
eternal uniformity, or an extremely slow progress in
one direction throughout countless ages; at the other,
rapid and regular vibrations from day to day, or else
irregular and seemingly unsystematic vacillations due to
cyclonic storms, both of which types are repeated millions
of times during even a single glacial fluctuation.</p>

<p>The meaning of cosmic uniformity has been explained
in the preceding chapter. Its relation to the other types
of climatic sequences seems to be that it sets sharply
defined limits beyond which no changes of any kind have
ever gone since life, as we know it, first began. Secular
progression, on the other hand, means that in spite of all
manner of variations, now this way and then the other,
the normal climate of the earth, if there is such a thing,
has on the whole probably changed a little, perhaps becoming
more complex. After each period of continental
uplift and glaciation&mdash;for such are pre&euml;minently the
times of complexity&mdash;it is doubtful whether the earth has
ever returned to quite its former degree of monotony.
Today the earth has swung away from the great diversity
of the glacial period. Yet we still have contrasts of what
seem to us great magnitude. In low depressions, such as
Turfan in the central deserts of Eurasia, the thermometer
sometimes ranges from 0&deg;F. in the morning to 60&deg;
in the shade at noon. On a cloudy day in the Amazon
forest close to the seashore, on the contrary, the temperature
for months may rise to 85&deg; by day and sink no lower
than 75&deg; at night.</p>

<p>The reasons for the secular progression of the earth's
<!--File: cc042.png Page 18-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_18" title="pg 18"></a>
climate appear to be intimately connected with those
which have caused the next, and, in many respects, more
important type of climatic sequence, which consists of
geological oscillations. Both the progression and the
oscillations seem to depend largely on three purely terrestrial
factors: first, the condition of the earth's interior,
including both internal heat and contraction;
second, the salinity and movement of the ocean; and
third, the composition and amount of the atmosphere.
To begin with the earth's interior&mdash;its loss of heat appears
to be an almost negligible factor in explaining
either secular progression or geologic oscillation. According
to both the nebular and the planetesimal hypotheses,
the earth's crust appears to be colder now than it was
hundreds or thousands of millions of years ago. The
emission of internal heat, however, had probably ceased
to be of much climatic significance near the beginning of
the geological record, for in southern Canada glaciation
occurred very early in the Proterozoic era. On the other
hand, the contraction of the earth has produced remarkable
effects throughout the whole of geological time. It
has lessened the earth's circumference by a thousand
miles or more, as appears from the way in which the
rocks have been folded and thrust bodily over one
another. According to the laws of dynamics this must
have increased the speed of the earth's rotation, thus
shortening the day, and also having the more important
effect of increasing the bulge at the equator. On the other
hand, recent investigations indicate that tidal retardation
has probably diminished the earth's rate of rotation
more than seemed probable a few years ago, thus lengthening
the day and diminishing the bulge at the equator.
Thus two opposing forces have been at work, one causing
acceleration and one retardation. Their combined
<!--File: cc043.png Page 19-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_19" title="pg 19"></a>
effect may have been a factor in causing secular progression
of climate. It almost certainly was of much importance
in causing pronounced oscillations first one way
and then the other. This matter, together with most of
those touched in these first chapters, will be expanded in
later parts of the book. On the whole the tendency appears
to have been to create climatic diversity in place
of uniformity.</p>

<p>The increasing salinity of the oceans may have been
another factor in producing secular progression, although
of slight importance in respect to oscillations.
While the oceans were still growing in volume, it is generally
assumed that they must have been almost fresh
for a vast period, although Chamberlin thinks that the
change in salinity has been much less than is usually
supposed. So far as the early oceans were fresher than
those of today, their deep-sea circulation must have been
less hampered than now by the heavy saline water which
is produced by evaporation in warm regions. Although
this saline water is warm, its weight causes it to descend,
instead of moving poleward in a surface current; this
descent slows up the rise of the cold water which has
moved along in the depths of the ocean from high latitudes,
and thus checks the general oceanic circulation.
If the ancient oceans were fresher and hence had a freer
circulation than now, a more rapid interchange of polar
and equatorial water presumably tended to equalize the
climate of all latitudes.</p>

<p>Again, although the earth's atmosphere has probably
changed far less during geological times than was
formerly supposed, its composition has doubtless varied.
The total volume of nitrogen has probably increased, for
that gas is so inert that when it once becomes a part of
the air it is almost sure to stay there. On the other hand,
<!--File: cc044.png Page 20-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_20" title="pg 20"></a>
the proportions of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water
vapor must have fluctuated. Oxygen is taken out constantly
by animals and by all the processes of rock
weathering, but on the other hand the supply is increased
when plants break up new carbon dioxide derived from
volcanoes. As for the carbon dioxide, it appears probable
that in spite of the increased supply furnished by
volcanoes the great amounts of carbon which have gradually
been locked up in coal and limestone have appreciably
depleted the atmosphere. Water vapor also may
be less abundant now than in the past, for the presence
of carbon dioxide raises the temperature a little and
thereby enables the air to hold more moisture. When the
area of the oceans has diminished, and this has recurred
very often, this likewise would tend to reduce the water
vapor. Moreover, even a very slight diminution in the
amount of heat given off by the earth, or a decrease in
evaporation because of higher salinity in the oceans,
would tend in the same direction. Now carbon dioxide and
water vapor both have a strong blanketing effect whereby
heat is prevented from leaving the earth. Therefore, the
probable reduction in the carbon dioxide and water
vapor of the earth's atmosphere has apparently tended
to reduce the climatic monotony and create diversity and
complexity. Hence, in spite of many reversals, the general
tendency of changes, not only in the earth's interior
and in the oceans, but also in the atmosphere, appears to
be a secular progression from a relatively monotonous
climate in which the evolution of higher organic forms
would scarcely be rapid to an extremely diverse and
complex climate highly favorable to progressive evolution.
The importance of these purely terrestrial agencies
must not be lost sight of when we come to discuss other
agencies outside the earth.</p>

<!--File: cc045.png Page 21-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_21" title="pg 21"></a>

<p>In Table 2 the next type of climatic sequence is geologic
oscillation. This means slow swings that last
millions of years. At one extreme of such an oscillation
the climate all over the world is relatively monotonous;
it returns, as it were, toward the primeval conditions at
the beginning of the secular progression. At such times
magnolias, sequoias, figs, tree ferns, and many other
types of subtropical plants grew far north in places like
Greenland, as is well known from their fossil remains of
middle Cenozoic time, for example. At these same times,
and also at many others before such high types of plants
had evolved, reef-making corals throve in great abundance
in seas which covered what is now Wisconsin,
Michigan, Ontario, and other equally cool regions. Today
these regions have an average temperature of only about
70&deg;F. in the warmest month, and average well below
freezing in winter. No reef-making corals can now live
where the temperature averages below 68&deg;F. The resemblance
of the ancient corals to those of today makes
it highly probable that they were equally sensitive to low
temperature. Thus, in the mild portions of a geologic
oscillation the climate seems to have been so equable and
uniform that many plants and animals could live 1500
and at other times even 4000 miles farther from the
equator than now.</p>

<p>At such times the lands in middle and high latitudes
were low and small, and the oceans extended widely over
the continental platforms. Thus unhampered ocean currents
had an opportunity to carry the heat of low latitudes
far toward the poles. Under such conditions, especially
if the conception of the great subequatorial
continent of Gondwana land is correct, the trade winds
and the westerlies must have been stronger and steadier
than now. This would not only enable the westerlies,
<!--File: cc046.png Page 22-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_22" title="pg 22"></a>
which are really southwesterlies, to carry more heat than
now to high latitudes, but would still further strengthen
the ocean currents. At the same time, the air presumably
contained an abundance of water vapor derived from
the broad oceans, and an abundance of atmospheric
carbon dioxide inherited from a preceding time when
volcanoes contributed much carbon dioxide to the air.
These two constituents of the atmosphere may have
exercised a pronounced blanketing effect whereby the
heat of the earth with its long wave lengths was kept in,
although the energy of the sun with its shorter wave
lengths was not markedly kept out. Thus everything may
have combined to produce mild conditions in high latitudes,
and to diminish the contrast between equator and
pole, and between summer and winter.</p>

<p>Such conditions perhaps carry in themselves the seeds
of decay. At any rate while the lands lie quiet during a
period of mild climate great strains must accumulate in
the crust because of the earth's contraction and tidal
retardation. At the same time the great abundance of
plants upon the lowlying plains with their mild climates,
and the marine creatures upon the broad continental
platforms, deplete the atmospheric carbon dioxide. Part
of this is locked up as coal and part as limestone derived
from marine plants as well as animals. Then something
happens so that the strains and stresses of the crust are
released. The sea floors sink; the continents become
relatively high and large; mountain ranges are formed;
and the former plains and emergent portions of the
continental platforms are eroded into hills and valleys.
The large size of the continents tends to create deserts
and other types of climatic diversity; the presence of
mountain ranges checks the free flow of winds and also
creates diversity; the ocean currents are likewise
<!--File: cc047.png Page 23-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_23" title="pg 23"></a>
checked, altered, and diverted so that the flow of heat
from low to high latitudes is diminished. At the same
time evaporation from the ocean diminishes so that a
decrease in water vapor combines with the previous depletion
of carbon dioxide to reduce the blanketing effect
of the atmosphere. Thus upon periods of mild monotony
there supervene periods of complexity, diversity, and
severity. Turn to Table 1 and see how a glacial climate
again and again succeeds a time when relative mildness
prevailed almost everywhere. Or examine Fig. 1 and
notice how the lines representing temperatures go up and
down. In the figure Schuchert makes it clear that when
the lands have been large and mountain-making has been
important, as shown by the high parts of the lower shaded
area, the climate has been severe, as shown by the descent
of the snow line, the upper shaded area. In the diagram
the climatic oscillations appear short, but this is merely
because they have been crowded together, especially in
the left hand or early part. There an inch in length may
represent a hundred million years. Even at the right-hand
end an inch is equivalent to several million years.</p>

<p>The severe part of a climatic oscillation, as well as the
mild part, will be shown in later chapters to bear in itself
certain probable seeds of decay. While the lands are
being uplifted, volcanic activity is likely to be vigorous
and to add carbon dioxide to the air. Later, as the mountains
are worn down by the many agencies of water,
wind, ice, and chemical decay, although much carbon
dioxide is locked up by the carbonation of the rocks, the
carbon locked up in the coal is set free and increases the
carbon dioxide of the air. At the same time the continents
settle slowly downward, for the earth's crust though
rigid as steel is nevertheless slightly viscous and will
flow if subjected to sufficiently great and enduring pressure.
<!--File: cc048.png Pae 24-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_24" title="pg 24"></a>
The area from which evaporation can take place
is thereby increased because of the spread of the oceans
over the continents, and water vapor joins with the carbon
dioxide to blanket the earth and thus tends to keep it
uniformly warm. Moreover, the diminution of the lands
frees the ocean currents from restraint and permits them
to flow more freely from low latitudes to high. Thus in
the course of millions of years there is a return toward
monotony. Ultimately, however, new stresses accumulate
in the earth's crust, and the way is prepared for another
great oscillation. Perhaps the setting free of the stresses
takes place simply because the strain at last becomes
irresistible. It is also possible, as we shall see, that an
external agency sometimes adds to the strain and thereby
determines the time at which a new oscillation shall
begin.</p>

<p>In Table 2 the types of climatic sequences which follow
"geologic oscillations" are "glacial fluctuations,"
"orbital precessions" and "historical pulsations."
Glacial fluctuations and historical pulsations appear to
be of the same type, except as to severity and duration,
and hence may be considered together. They will be
treated briefly here because the theories as to their
causes are outlined in the next two chapters. Oddly
enough, although the historic pulsations lie much closer
to us than do the glacial fluctuations, they were not
discovered until two or three generations later, and are
still much less known. The most important feature of
both sequences is the swing from a glacial to an inter-glacial
epoch or from the arsis or accentuated part of an
historical pulsation to the thesis or unaccented part. In a
glacial epoch or in the arsis of an historic pulsation,
storms are usually abundant and severe, the mean temperature
is lower than usual, snow accumulates in high
<!--File: cc049.png Page 25-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_25" title="pg 25"></a>

<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_26" title="pg 26"></a>

latitudes or upon lofty mountains. For example, in the
last such period during the fourteenth century, great
floods and droughts occurred alternately around the
North Sea; it was several times possible to cross the
Baltic Sea from Germany to Sweden on the ice, and the
ice of Greenland advanced so much that shore ice caused
the Norsemen to change their sailing route between Iceland
and the Norse colonies in southern Greenland. At
the same time in low latitudes and in parts of the continental
interior there is a tendency toward diminished
rainfall and even toward aridity and the formation of
deserts. In Yucatan, for example, a diminution in tropical
rainfall in the fourteenth century seems to have given
the Mayas a last opportunity for a revival of their decaying
civilization.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Diagram showing the times and probable extent of the more or less marked climate changes in
the geologic history of North America, and of its elevation into chains of mountains.</p>

<p>Among the climatic sequences, glacial fluctuations are
perhaps of the most vital import from the standpoint of
organic evolution; from the standpoint of human history
the same is true of climatic pulsations. Glacial epochs
have repeatedly wiped out thousands upon thousands of
species and played a part in the origin of entirely new
types of plants and animals. This is best seen when the
life of the Pennsylvanian is contrasted with that of the
Permian. An historic pulsation may wipe out an entire
civilization and permit a new one to grow up with a radically
different character. Hence it is not strange that the
causes of such climatic phenomena have been discussed
with extraordinary vigor. In few realms of science has
there been a more imposing or more interesting array of
theories. In this book we shall consider the more important
of these theories. A new solar or cyclonic hypothesis
and the hypothesis of changes in the form and altitude of
the land will receive the most attention, but the other

<!--File: cc051.png Page 27-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_27" title="pg 27"></a>

chief hypotheses are outlined in the next chapter, and are
frequently referred to throughout the volume.</p>

<p>Between glacial fluctuations and historical pulsations
in duration, but probably less severe than either, come
orbital precessions. These stand in a group by themselves
and are more akin to seasonal alternations than
to any other type of climatic sequence. They must have
occurred with absolute regularity ever since the earth
began to revolve around the sun in its present elliptical
orbit. Since the orbit is elliptical and since the sun is in
one of the two foci of the ellipse, the earth's distance
from the sun varies. At present the earth is nearest the
sun in the northern winter. Hence the rigor of winter in
the northern hemisphere is mitigated, while that of the
southern hemisphere is increased. In about ten thousand
years this condition will be reversed, and in another ten
thousand the present conditions will return once more.
Such climatic precessions, as we may here call them,
must have occurred unnumbered times in the past, but
they do not appear to have been large enough to leave in
the fossils of the rocks any traces that can be distinguished
from those of other climatic sequences.</p>

<p>We come now to Br&uuml;ckner periods and sunspot cycles.
The Br&uuml;ckner periods have a length of about thirty-three
years. Their existence was suggested at least as long ago
as the days of Sir Francis Bacon, whose statement about
them is quoted on the flyleaf of this book. They have
since been detected by a careful study of the records of
the time of harvest, vintage, the opening of rivers to
navigation, and the rise or fall of lakes like the Caspian
Sea. In his book on <em>Klimaschwankungen seit 1700</em>,
Br&uuml;ckner has collected an uncommonly interesting assortment
of facts as to the climate of Europe for more than
two centuries. More recently, by a study of the rate of

<!--File: cc052.png Page 28-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_28" title="pg 28"></a>

growth of trees, Douglass, in his book on <em>Climatic Cycles
and Tree Growth</em>, has carried the subject still further.
In general the nature of the 33-year periods seems to be
identical with that of the 11- or 12- year sunspot cycle,
on the one hand, and of historic pulsations on the other.
For a century observers have noted that the variations
in the weather which everyone notices from year to year
seem to have some relation to sunspots. For generations,
however, the relationship was discussed without leading
to any definite conclusion. The trouble was that the same
change was supposed to take place in all parts of the
world. Hence, when every sort of change was found
somewhere at any given sunspot stage, it seemed as
though there could not be a relationship. Of late years,
however, the matter has become fairly clear. The chief
conclusions are, first, that when sunspots are numerous
the average temperature of the earth's surface is lower
than normal. This does not mean that all parts are cooler,
for while certain large areas grow cool, others of less
extent become warm at times of many sunspots. Second,
at times of many sunspots storms are more abundant
than usual, but are also confined somewhat closely to
certain limited tracks so that elsewhere a diminution of
storminess may be noted. This whole question is discussed
so fully in <em>Earth and Sun</em> that it need not detain
us further in this preliminary view of the whole problem
of climate. Suffice it to say that a study of the sunspot
cycle leads to the conclusion that it furnishes a clue to
many of the unsolved problems of the climate of the
past, as well as a key to prediction of the future.</p>

<p>Passing by the seasonal alternations which are fully
explained as the result of the revolution of the earth
around the sun, we may merely point out that, like the
daily vibrations which bring Table 2 to a close, they
<!--File: cc053.png Page 29-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_29" title="pg 29"></a>
emphasize the outstanding fact that the main control of
terrestrial climate is the amount of energy received from
the sun. This same principle is illustrated by pleionian
migrations. The term "pleion" comes from a Greek word
meaning "more." It was taken by Arctowski to designate
areas or periods where there is an excess of some
climatic element, such as atmospheric pressure, rainfall,
or temperature. Even if the effect of the seasons is eliminated,
it appears that the course of these various elements
does not run smoothly. As everyone knows, a period
like the autumn of 1920 in the eastern United States may
be unusually warm, while a succeeding period may be
unseasonably cool. These departures from the normal
show a certain rough periodicity. For example, there is
evidence of a period of about twenty-seven days, corresponding
to the sun's rotation and formerly supposed to
be due to the moon's revolution which occupies almost
the same length of time. Still other periods appear to
have an average duration of about three months and of
between two and three years. Two remarkable discoveries
have recently been made in respect to such pleions. One
is that a given type of change usually occurs simultaneously
in a number of well-defined but widely separated
centers, while a change of an opposite character arises
in another equally well-defined, but quite different, set
of centers. In general, areas of high pressure have one
type of change and areas of low pressure the other type.
So systematic are these relationships and so completely
do they harmonize in widely separated parts of the earth,
that it seems certain that they must be due to some outside
cause, which in all probability can be only the sun.
The second discovery is that pleions, when once formed,
travel irregularly along the earth's surface. Their paths
have not yet been worked out in detail, but a general
<!--File: cc054.png Page 30-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_30" title="pg 30"></a>
migration seems well established. Because of this, it is
probable that if unusually warm weather prevails in one
part of a continent at a given time, the "thermo-pleion,"
or excess of heat, will not vanish but will gradually move
away in some particular direction. If we knew the path
that it would follow we might predict the general temperature
along its course for some months in advance.
The paths are often irregular, and the pleions frequently
show a tendency to break up or suddenly revive. Probably
this tendency is due to variations in the sun. When
the sun is highly variable, the pleions are numerous and
strong, and extremes of weather are frequent. Taken as
a whole the pleions offer one of the most interesting and
hopeful fields not only for the student of the causes of
climatic variations, but for the man who is interested in
the practical question of long-range weather forecasts.
Like many other climatic phenomena they seem to represent
the combined effect of conditions in the sun and
upon the earth itself.</p>

<p>The last of the climatic sequences which require explanation
is the cyclonic vacillations. These are familiar
to everyone, for they are the changes of weather which
occur at intervals of a few days, or a week or two, at all
seasons, in large parts of the United States, Europe,
Japan, and some of the other progressive parts of the
earth. They do not, however, occur with great frequency
in equatorial regions, deserts, and many other regions.
Up to the end of the last century, it was generally supposed
that cyclonic storms were purely terrestrial in
origin. Without any adequate investigation it was assumed
that all irregularities in the planetary circulation
of the winds arise from an irregular distribution of heat
due to conditions within or upon the earth itself. These
irregularities were supposed to produce cyclonic storms
<!--File: cc055.png Page 31-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_31" title="pg 31"></a>
in certain limited belts, but not in most parts of the
world. Today this view is being rapidly modified. Undoubtedly,
the irregularities due to purely terrestrial
conditions are one of the chief contributory causes of
storms, but it begins to appear that solar variations also
play a part. It has been found, for example, that not
only the mean temperature of the earth's surface varies
in harmony with the sunspot cycle, but that the frequency
and severity of storms vary in the same way. Moreover,
it has been demonstrated that the sun's radiation is not
constant, but is subject to innumerable variations. This
does not mean that the sun's general temperature varies,
but merely that at some times heated gases are ejected
rapidly to high levels so that a sudden wave of energy
strikes the earth. Thus, the present tendency is to believe
that the cyclonic variations, the changes of weather
which come and go in such a haphazard, irresponsible
way, are partly due to causes pertaining to the earth
itself and partly to the sun.</p>

<p>From this rapid survey of the types of climatic sequences,
it is evident that they may be divided into four
great groups. First comes cosmic uniformity, one of the
most marvelous and incomprehensible of all known facts.
We simply have no explanation which is in any respect
adequate. Next come secular progression and geologic
oscillations, two types of change which seem to be due
mainly to purely terrestrial causes, that is, to changes in
the lands, the oceans, and the air. The general tendency
of these changes is toward complexity and diversity, thus
producing progression, but they are subject to frequent
reversals which give rise to oscillations lasting millions
of years. The processes by which the oscillations take
place are fully discussed in this book. Nevertheless, because
they are fairly well understood, they are deferred
<!--File: cc056.png Page 32-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_32" title="pg 32"></a>
until after the third group of sequences has been discussed.
This group includes glacial fluctuations, historic
pulsations, Br&uuml;ckner periods, sunspot cycles, pleionian
migrations, and cyclonic vacillations. The outstanding
fact in regard to all of these is that while they are greatly
modified by purely terrestrial conditions, they seem to
owe their origin to variations in the sun. They form the
chief subject of <em>Earth and Sun</em> and in their larger phases
are the most important topic of this book also. The last
group of sequences includes orbital precessions, seasonal
alternations, and daily variations. These may be regarded
as purely solar in origin. Yet their influence, like
that of each of the other groups, is much modified by the
earth's own conditions. Our main problem is to separate
and explain the two great elements in climatic changes,&mdash;the
effects of the sun, on the one hand, and of the earth
on the other.</p>

<h3>HYPOTHESES OF CLIMATIC CHANGE</h3>


<p>The next step in our study of climate is to review
the main hypotheses as to the causes of glaciation.
These hypotheses apply also to other types
of climatic changes. We shall concentrate on glacial
periods, however, not only because they are the most
dramatic and well-known types of change, but because
they have been more discussed than any other and have
also had great influence on evolution. Moreover, they
stand near the middle of the types of climatic sequences,
and an understanding of them does much to explain the
others. In reviewing the various theories we shall not
attempt to cover all the ground, but shall merely state
the main ideas of the few theories which have had an
important influence upon scientific thought.</p>

<p>The conditions which any satisfactory climatic hypothesis
must satisfy are briefly as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>Due weight must be given to the fact that changes
of climate are almost certainly due to the combined effect
of a variety of causes, both terrestrial and solar or
cosmic.</li>

<li>Attention must also be paid to both sides in the
long controversy as to whether glaciation is due primarily
to a diminution in the earth's supply of heat or to
a <em>redistribution</em> of the heat through changes in atmospheric
and oceanic circulation. At present the great
<!--File: cc058.png Page 34-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_34" title="pg 34"></a>
majority of authorities are on the side of a diminution of
heat, but the other view also deserves study.</li>

<li>A satisfactory hypothesis must explain the frequent
synchronism between two great types of phenomena;
first, movements of the earth's crust whereby
continents are uplifted and mountains upheaved; and,
second, great changes of climate which are usually
marked by relatively rapid oscillations from one extreme
to another.</li>

<li>No hypothesis can find acceptance unless it satisfies
the somewhat exacting requirements of the geological
record, with its frequent but irregular repetition of long,
mild periods, relatively cool or intermediate periods like
the present, and glacial periods of more or less severity
and perhaps accompanying the more or less widespread
uplifting of continents. At least during the later glacial
periods the hypothesis must explain numerous climatic
epochs and stages superposed upon a single general
period of continental upheaval. Moreover, although historical
geology demands cycles of varied duration and
magnitude, it does not furnish evidence of any rigid
periodicity causing the cycles to be uniform in length or
intensity.</li>

<li>Most important of all, a satisfactory explanation
of climatic changes and crustal deformation must take
account of all the agencies which are now causing similar
phenomena. Whether any other agencies should be considered
is open to question, although the relative importance
of existing agencies may have varied.

<p>I. <em>Croll's Eccentricity Theory.</em> One of the most ingenious
and most carefully elaborated scientific hypotheses
is Croll's<sup><a href="#fn10" id="r10">[10]</a></sup> precessional hypothesis as to the
effect of the earth's own motions. So well was this worked
out that it was widely accepted for a time and still finds a
<!--File: cc059.png Page 35-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_35" title="pg 35"></a>
place in popular but unscientific books, such as Wells'
<em>Outline of History</em>, and even in scientific works like
Wright's <em>Quaternary Ice Age</em>. The gist of the hypothesis
has already been given in connection with the type of
climatic sequence known as orbital precessions. The earth
is 93 million miles away from the sun in January and 97
million in July. The earth's axis "precesses," however,
just as does that of a spinning top. Hence arises what is
known as the precession of the equinoxes, that is, a
steady change in the season at which the earth is in perihelion,
or nearest to the sun. In the course of 21,000 years
the time of perihelion varies from early in January
through the entire twelve months and back to January.
Moreover, the earth's orbit is slightly more elliptical at
certain periods than at others, for the planets sometimes
become bunched so that they all pull the earth in one
direction. Hence, once in about one hundred thousand
years the effect of the elliptical shape of the earth's orbit
is at a maximum.</p>

<p>Croll argued that these astronomical changes must
alter the earth's climate, especially by their effect on
winds and ocean currents. His elaborate argument contains
a vast amount of valuable material. Later investigation,
however, seems to have proven the inadequacy of
his hypothesis. In the first place, the supposed cause does
not seem nearly sufficient to produce the observed results.
Second, Croll's hypothesis demands that glaciation in the
northern and southern hemisphere take place alternately.
A constantly growing collection of facts, however, indicates
that glaciation does not occur in the two hemispheres
alternately, but at the same time. Third, the
hypothesis calls for the constant and frequent repetition
of glaciation at absolutely regular intervals. The geological
<!--File: cc060.png Page 36-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_36" title="pg 36"></a>
record shows no such regularity, for sometimes
several glacial epochs follow in relatively close succession
at irregular intervals of perhaps fifty to two hundred
thousand years, and thus form a glacial period; and
then for millions of years there are none. Fourth, the
eccentricity hypothesis provides no adequate explanation
for the glacial stages or subepochs, the historic pulsations,
and the other smaller climatic variations which are
superposed upon glacial epochs and upon one another in
bewildering confusion. In spite of these objections, there
can be little question that the eccentricity of the earth's
orbit and the precession of the equinoxes with the resulting
change in the season of perihelion must have some
climatic effect. Hence Croll's theory deserves a permanent
though minor place in any full discussion of the
causes of climatic changes.</p>

<p>II. <em>The Carbon Dioxide Theory.</em> At about the time
that the eccentricity theory was being relegated to a
minor niche, a new theory was being developed which
soon exerted a profound influence upon geological
thought. Chamberlin,<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11">[11]</a></sup> adopting an idea suggested by
<!--File: cc061.png Page 37-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_37" title="pg 37"></a>
Tyndall, fired the imagination of geologists by his skillful
exposition of the part played by carbon dioxide in
causing climatic changes. Today this theory is probably
more widely accepted than any other. We have already
seen that the amount of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere
has a decided climatic importance. Moreover,
there can be little doubt that the amount of that gas in
the atmosphere varies from age to age in response to the
extent to which it is set free by volcanoes, consumed by
plants, combined with rocks in the process of weathering,
dissolved in the ocean or locked up in the form of coal
and limestone. The main question is whether such variations
can produce changes so rapid as glacial epochs and
historical pulsations.</p>

<p>Abundant evidence seems to show that the degree to
which the air can be warmed by carbon dioxide is sharply
limited. Humphreys, in his excellent book on the <em>Physics
of the Air</em>, calculates that a layer of carbon dioxide forty
centimeters thick has practically as much blanketing
effect as a layer indefinitely thicker. In other words, forty
centimeters of carbon dioxide, while having no appreciable
<!--File: cc062.png Page 38-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_38" title="pg 38"></a>
effect on sunlight coming toward the earth, would
filter out and thus retain in the atmosphere all the outgoing
terrestrial heat that carbon dioxide is capable of
absorbing. Adding more would be like adding another
filter when the one in operation has already done all that
that particular kind of filter is capable of doing. According
to Humphreys' calculations, a doubling of the carbon
dioxide in the air would in itself raise the average temperature
about 1.3&deg;C. and further carbon dioxide would
have practically no effect. Reducing the present supply
by half would reduce the temperature by essentially the
same amount.</p>

<p>The effect must be greater, however, than would appear
from the figures given above, for any change in
temperature has an effect on the amount of water vapor,
which in turn causes further changes of temperature.
Moreover, as Chamberlin points out, it is not clear
whether Humphreys allows for the fact that when the
40 centimeters of CO<sub>2</sub> nearest the earth has been heated
by terrestrial radiation, it in turn radiates half its heat
outward and half inward. The outward half is all absorbed
in the next layer of carbon dioxide, and so on.
The process is much more complex than this, but the end
result is that even the last increment of CO<sub>2</sub>, that is, the
outermost portions in the upper atmosphere, must apparently
absorb an infinitesimally small amount of heat.
This fact, plus the effect of water vapor, would seem to
indicate that a doubling or halving of the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>,
would have an effect of more than 1.3&deg;C. A change of
even 2&deg;C. above or below the present level of the earth's
mean temperature would be of very appreciable climatic
significance, for it is commonly believed that during the
height of the glacial period the mean temperature was
only 5&deg; to 8&deg;C. lower than now.</p>
<!--File: cc063.png Page 39-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_39" title="pg 37"></a>

<p>Nevertheless, variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide
do not necessarily seem competent to produce the relatively
rapid climatic fluctuations of glacial epochs and
historic pulsations as distinguished from the longer
swings of glacial periods and geological eras. In Chamberlin's
view, as in ours, the elevation of the land, the
modification of the currents of the air and of the ocean,
and all that goes with elevation as a topographic agency
constitute a primary cause of climatic changes. A special
effect of this is the removal of carbon dioxide from the
air by the enhanced processes of weathering. This, as he
carefully states, is a very slow process, and cannot of
itself lead to anything so sudden as the oncoming of
glaciation. But here comes Chamberlin's most distinctive
contribution to the subject, namely, the hypothesis that
changes in atmospheric temperature arising from variations
in atmospheric carbon dioxide are able to cause a
reversal of the deep-sea oceanic circulation.</p>

<p>According to Chamberlin's view, the ordinary oceanic
circulation of the greater part of geological time was
the reverse of the present circulation. Warm water descended
to the ocean depths in low latitudes, kept its heat
while creeping slowly poleward, and rose in high latitudes
producing the warm climate which enabled corals,
for example, to grow in high latitudes. Chamberlin holds
this opinion largely because there seems to him to be no
other reasonable way to account for the enormously long
warm periods when heat-loving forms of life lived in
what are now polar regions of ice and snow. He explains
this reversed circulation by supposing that an abundance
of atmospheric carbon dioxide, together with a broad
distribution of the oceans, made the atmosphere so warm
that the evaporation in low latitudes was far more rapid
than now. Hence the surface water of the ocean became
<!--File: cc064.png Page 40-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_40" title="pg 40"></a>
a relatively concentrated brine. Such a brine is heavy
and tends to sink, thereby setting up an oceanic circulation
the reverse of that which now prevails. At present
the polar waters sink because they are cold and hence
contract. Moreover, when they freeze a certain amount
of salt leaves the ice and thereby increases the salinity
of the surrounding water. Thus the polar water sinks
to the depths of the ocean, its place is taken by warmer
and lighter water from low latitudes which moves poleward
along the surface, and at the same time the cold
water of the ocean depths is forced equatorward below
the surface. But if the equatorial waters were so concentrated
that a steady supply of highly saline water kept
descending to low levels, the direction of the circulation
would have to be reversed. The time when this would
occur would depend upon the delicate balance between
the downward tendencies of the cold polar water and of
the warm saline equatorial water.</p>

<p>Suppose that while such a reversed circulation prevailed,
the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> should be depleted, and the
air cooled so much that the concentration of the equatorial
waters by evaporation was no longer sufficient to
cause them to sink. A reversal would take place, the
present type of circulation would be inaugurated, and
the whole earth would suffer a chill because the surface
of the ocean would become cool. The cool surface-water
would absorb carbon dioxide faster than the previous
warm water had done, for heat drives off gases
from water. This would hasten the cooling of the atmosphere
still more, not only directly but by diminishing
the supply of atmospheric moisture. The result would be
glaciation. But ultimately the cold waters of the higher
latitudes would absorb all the carbon dioxide they could
hold, the slow equatorward creep would at length permit
<!--File: cc065.png Page 41-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_41" title="pg 41"></a>
the cold water to rise to the surface in low latitudes.
There the warmth of the equatorial sun and the depleted
supply of carbon dioxide in the air would combine to
cause the water to give up its carbon dioxide once more.
If the atmosphere had been sufficiently depleted by that
time, the rising waters in low latitudes might give up
more carbon dioxide than the cold polar waters absorbed.
Thus the atmospheric supply would increase, the air
would again grow warm, and a tendency toward deglaciation,
or toward an inter-glacial condition would
arise. At such times the oceanic circulation is not supposed
to have been reversed, but merely to have been
checked and made slower by the increasing warmth.
Thus inter-glacial conditions like those of today, or even
considerably warmer, are supposed to have been produced
with the present type of circulation.</p>

<p>The emission of carbon dioxide in low latitudes could
not permanently exceed the absorption in high latitudes.
After the present type of circulation was finally established,
which might take tens of thousands of years, the
two would gradually become equal. Then the conditions
which originally caused the oceanic circulation to be
reversed would again destroy the balance; the atmospheric
carbon dioxide would be depleted; the air would
grow cooler; and the cycle of glaciation would be repeated.
Each cycle would be shorter than the last, for not
only would the swings diminish like those of a pendulum,
but the agencies that were causing the main depletion of
the atmospheric carbon dioxide would diminish in intensity.
Finally as the lands became lower through erosion
and submergence, and as the processes of weathering
became correspondingly slow, the air would gradually be
able to accumulate carbon dioxide; the temperature would
increase; and at length the oceanic circulation would be
<!--File: cc066.png Page 42-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_42" title="pg 42"></a>
reversed again. When the warm saline waters of low latitudes
finally began to sink and to set up a flow of warm
water poleward in the depths of the ocean, a glacial
period would definitely come to an end.</p>

<p>This hypothesis has been so skillfully elaborated, and
contains so many important elements that one can
scarcely study it without profound admiration. We believe
that it is of the utmost value as a step toward the
truth, and especially because it emphasizes the great
function of oceanic circulation. Nevertheless, we are
unable to accept it in full for several reasons, which
may here be stated very briefly. Most of them will be discussed
fully in later pages.</p>

<p>(1) While a reversal of the deep-sea circulation would
undoubtedly be of great climatic importance and would
produce a warm climate in high latitudes, we see no
direct evidence of such a reversal. It is equally true that
there is no conclusive evidence against it, and the possibility
of a reversal must not be overlooked. There seem,
however, to be other modifications of atmospheric and
oceanic circulation which are able to produce the observed
results.</p>

<p>(2) There is much, and we believe conclusive, evidence
that a mere lowering of temperature would not produce
glaciation. What seems to be needed is changes in atmospheric
circulation and in precipitation. The carbon
dioxide hypothesis has not been nearly so fully developed
on the meteorological side as in other respects.</p>

<p>(3) The carbon dioxide hypothesis seems to demand
that the oceans should have been almost as saline as now
in the Proterozoic era at the time of the first known
glaciation. Chamberlin holds that such was the case, but
the constant supply of saline material brought to the
ocean by rivers and the relatively small deposition of
<!--File: cc067.png Page 43-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_43" title="pg 43"></a>
such material on the sea floor seem to indicate that the
early oceans must have been much fresher than those of
today.</p>

<p>(4) The carbon dioxide hypothesis does not attempt
to explain minor climatic fluctuations such as post-glacial
stages and historic pulsations, but these appear to be of
the same nature as glacial epochs, differing only in
degree.</p>

<p>(5) Another reason for hesitation in accepting the
carbon dioxide hypothesis as a full explanation of glacial
fluctuations is the highly complex and non-observational
character of the explanation of the alternation of glacial
and inter-glacial epochs and of their constantly decreasing
length.</p>

<p>(6) Most important of all, a study of the variations of
weather and of climate as they are disclosed by present
records and by the historic past suggests that there are
now in action certain other causes which are competent
to explain glaciation without recourse to a process whose
action is beyond the realm of observation.</p>

<p>These considerations lead to the conclusion that the
carbon dioxide hypothesis and the reversal of the oceanic
circulation should be regarded as a tentative rather than
a final explanation of glaciation. Nevertheless, the action
of carbon dioxide seems to be an important factor in producing
the longer oscillations of climate from one geological
era to another. It probably plays a considerable
part in preparing the way for glacial periods and in
making it possible for other factors to produce the more
rapid changes which have so deeply influenced organic
evolution.</p>

<p>III. <em>The Form of the Land.</em> Another great cause of
climatic change consists of a group of connected phenomena
dependent upon movements of the earth's crust.
<!--File: cc068.png Page 44-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_44" title="pg 44"></a>
As to the climatic potency of changes in the lands there
is practical agreement among students of climatology
and glaciation. That the height and extent of the continents,
the location, size, and orientation of mountain
ranges, and the opening and closing of oceanic gateways
at places like Panama, and the consequent diversion of
oceanic currents, exert a profound effect upon climate
can scarcely be questioned. Such changes may be introduced
rapidly, but their disappearance is usually slow
compared with the rapid pulsations to which climate has
been subject during historic times and during stages of
glacial retreat and advance, or even in comparison with
the epochs into which the Pleistocene, Permian, and
perhaps earlier glacial periods have been divided. Hence,
while crustal movements appear to be more important
than the eccentricity of the earth's orbit or the amount of
carbon dioxide in the air, they do not satisfactorily explain
glacial fluctuations, historic pulsations, and especially
the present little cycles of climatic change. All
these changes involve a relatively rapid swing from one
extreme to another, while an upheaval of a continent,
which is at best a slow geologic process, apparently
cannot be undone for a long, long time. Hence such an
upheaval, if acting alone, would lead to a relatively long-lived
climate of a somewhat extreme type. It would help
to explain the long swings, or geologic oscillations between
a mild and uniform climate at one extreme, and a
complex and varied climate at the other, but it would not
explain the rapid climatic pulsations which are closely
associated with great movements of the earth's crust. It
might prepare the way for them, but could not cause
them. That this conclusion is true is borne out by the fact
that vast mountain ranges, like those at the close of the
Jurassic and Cretaceous, are upheaved without bringing
<!--File: cc069.png Page 45-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_45" title="pg 45"></a>
on glacial climates. Moreover, the marked Permian ice
age follows long after the birth of the Hercynian Mountains
and before the rise of others of later Permian
origin.</p>

<p>IV. <em>The Volcanic Hypothesis.</em> In the search for some
cause of climatic change which is highly efficient and yet
able to vary rapidly and independently, Abbot, Fowle,
Humphreys, and others,<sup><a href="#fn12" id="r12">[12]</a></sup> have concluded that volcanic
eruptions are the missing agency. In <em>Physics of the Air</em>,
Humphreys gives a careful study of the effect of volcanic
dust upon terrestrial temperature. He begins with
a mathematical investigation of the size of dust particles,
and their quantity after certain eruptions. He demonstrates
that the power of such particles to deflect light of
short wave-lengths coming from the sun is perhaps thirty
times more than their power to retain the heat radiated
in long waves from the earth. Hence it is estimated that
if a Krakatoa were to belch forth dust every year or
two, the dust veil might cause a reduction of about 6&deg;C.
in the earth's surface temperature. As in every such complicated
problem, some of the author's assumptions are
open to question, but this touches their quantitative and
not their qualitative value. It seems certain that if volcanic
explosions were frequent enough and violent
enough, the temperature of the earth's surface would be
considerably lowered.</p>

<p>Actual observation supports this theoretical conclusion.
Humphreys gathers together and amplifies all that
he and Abbot and Fowle have previously said as to observations
of the sun's thermal radiation by means of the
<!--File: cc070.png Page 46-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_46" title="pg 46"></a>
pyrheliometer. This summing up of the relations between
the heat received from the sun, and the occurrence of
explosive volcanic eruptions leaves little room for doubt
that at frequent intervals during the last century and a
half a slight lowering of terrestrial temperature has
actually occurred after great eruptions. Nevertheless, it
does not justify Humphreys' final conclusion that "phenomena
within the earth itself suffice to modify its own
climate,... that these and these alone have actually
caused great changes time and again in the geologic
past." Humphreys sees so clearly the importance of the
purely terrestrial point of view that he unconsciously
slights the cosmic standpoint and ignores the important
solar facts which he himself adduces elsewhere at considerable
length.</p>

<p>In addition to this the <em>degree</em> to which the temperature
of the earth as a whole is influenced by volcanic eruptions
is by no means so clear as is the fact that there is some
influence. Arctowski,<sup><a href="#fn13" id="r13">[13]</a></sup> for example, has prepared numerous
curves showing the march of temperature month
after month for many years. During the period from
1909 to 1913, which includes the great eruption of Katmai
in Alaska, low temperature is found to have prevailed at
the time of the eruption, but, as Arctowski puts it, on the
basis of the curves for 150 stations in all parts of the
world: "The supposition that these abnormally low temperatures
were due to the veil of volcanic dust produced
by the Katmai eruption of June 6, 1912, is completely out
of the question. If that had been the case, temperature
would have decreased from that date on, whereas it was
decreasing for more than a year before that date."</p>
<!--File: cc071.png Page 47-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_47" title="pg 47"></a>

<p>K&ouml;ppen,<sup><a href="#fn14" id="r14">[14]</a></sup> in his comprehensive study of temperature
for a hundred years, also presents a strong argument
against the idea that volcanic eruptions have an important
place in determining the present temperature of
the earth. A volcanic eruption is a sudden occurrence.
Whatever effect is produced by dust thrown into the air
must occur within a few months, or as soon as the dust
has had an opportunity to be wafted to the region in
question. When the dust arrives, there will be a rapid
drop through the few degrees of temperature which the
dust is supposed to be able to account for, and thereafter
a slow rise of temperature. If volcanic eruptions actually
caused a frequent lowering of terrestrial temperature in
the hundred years studied by K&ouml;ppen, there should be
more cases where the annual temperature is decidedly
below the normal than where it shows a large departure
in the opposite direction. The contrary is actually the
case.</p>

<p>A still more important argument is the fact that the
earth is now in an intermediate condition of climate.
Throughout most of geologic time, as we shall see again
and again, the climate of the earth has been milder than
now. Regions like Greenland have not been the seat of
glaciers, but have been the home of types of plants which
now thrive in relatively low latitudes. In other words, the
earth is today only part way from a glacial epoch to what
may be called the normal, mild climate of the earth&mdash;a
climate in which the contrast from zone to zone was much
less than now, and the lower air averaged warmer. Hence
it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that the
cause of glaciation is still operating with considerable
<!--File: cc072.png Page 48-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_48" title="pg 48"></a>
although diminished efficiency. But volcanic dust is
obviously not operating to any appreciable extent at
present, for the upper air is almost free from dust a large
part of the time.</p>

<p>Again, as Chamberlin suggests, let it be supposed that
a Krakatoan eruption every two years would produce a
glacial period. Unless the most experienced field workers
on the glacial formations are quite in error, the various
glacial epochs of the Pleistocene glacial period had a
joint duration of at least 150,000 years and perhaps twice
as much. That would require 75,000 Krakatoan eruptions.
But where are the pits and cones of such eruptions?
There has not been time to erode them away since the
Pleistocene glaciation. Their beds of volcanic ash would
presumably be as voluminous as the glacial beds, but
there do not seem to be accumulations of any such size.
Even though the same volcano suffered repeated explosions,
it seems impossible to find sufficient fresh volcanic
debris. Moreover, the volcanic hypothesis has not yet
offered any mechanism for systematic glacial variations.
Hence, while the hypothesis is important, we must search
further for the full explanation of glacial fluctuations,
historic pulsations, and the earth's present quasi-glacial
climate.</p>

<p>V. <em>The Hypothesis of Polar Wandering.</em> Another hypothesis,
which has some adherents, especially among
geologists, holds that the position of the earth's axis has
shifted repeatedly during geological times, thus causing
glaciation in regions which are not now polar. Astrophysicists,
however, are quite sure that no agency could
radically change the relation between the earth and its
axis without likewise altering the orbits of the planets to
a degree that would be easily recognized. Moreover, the
distribution of the centers of glaciation both in the Permian
<!--File: cc073.png Page 49-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_49" title="pg 49"></a>
and Pleistocene periods does not seem to conform
to this hypothesis.</p>

<p>VI. <em>The Thermal Solar Hypothesis.</em> The only other
explanations of the climatic changes of glacial and historic
times which now seem to have much standing are
two distinct and almost antagonistic solar hypotheses.
One is the idea that changes in the earth's climate are
due to variations in the heat emitted by the sun and
hence in the temperature of the earth. The other is the
entirely different idea that climatic changes arise from
solar conditions which cause a <em>redistribution of the
earth's atmospheric pressure</em> and hence produce changes
in winds, ocean currents, and especially storms. This
second, or "cyclonic," hypothesis is the subject of a book
entitled <em>Earth and Sun</em>, which is to be published as a
companion to the present volume. It will be outlined in
the next chapter. The other, or thermal, hypothesis may
be dismissed briefly. Unquestionably a permanent change
in the amount of heat emitted by the sun would permanently
alter the earth's climate. There is absolutely no
evidence, however, of any such change during geologic
time. The evidence as to the earth's cosmic uniformity
and as to secular progression is all against it. Suppose
that for thirty or forty thousand years the sun cooled off
enough so that the earth was as cool as during a glacial
epoch. As glaciation is soon succeeded by a mild climate,
some agency would then be needed to raise the sun's
temperature. The impact of a shower of meteorites might
accomplish this, but that would mean a very sudden heating,
such as there is no evidence of in geological history.
In fact, there is far more evidence of sudden cooling than
of sudden heating. Moreover, it is far beyond the bounds
of probability that such an impact should be repeated
again and again with just such force as to bring the climate
<!--File: cc074.png Page 50-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_50" title="pg 50"></a>
back almost to where it started and yet to allow for
the slight changes which cause secular progression.
Another and equally cogent objection to the thermal form
of solar hypothesis is stated by Humphreys as follows:
"A change of the solar constant obviously alters all surface
temperatures by a roughly constant percentage.
Hence a decrease of the heat from the sun would in general
cause a decrease of the interzonal temperature
gradients; and this in turn a less vigorous atmospheric
circulation, and a less copious rain or snowfall&mdash;exactly
the reverse of the condition, namely, abundant precipitation,
most favorable to extensive glaciation."</p>

<p>This brings us to the end of the main hypotheses as to
climatic changes, aside from the solar cyclonic hypothesis
which will be discussed in the next chapter. It appears
that variations in the position of the earth at perihelion
have a real though slight influence in causing cycles with
a length of about 21,000 years. Changes in the carbon
dioxide of the air probably have a more important but
extremely slow influence upon geologic oscillations.
Variations in the size, shape, and height of the continents
are constantly causing all manner of climatic complications,
but do not cause rapid fluctuations and pulsations.
The eruption of volcanic dust appears occasionally to
lower the temperature, but its potency to explain the
complex climatic changes recorded in the rocks has probably
been exaggerated. Finally, although minor changes
in the amount of heat given out by the sun occur constantly
and have been demonstrated to have a climatic
effect, there is no evidence that such changes are the main
cause of the climatic phenomena which we are trying to
explain. Nevertheless, in connection with other solar
changes they may be of high importance.</p>

<h3>THE SOLAR CYCLONIC HYPOTHESIS</h3>


<p>The progress of science is made up of a vast succession
of hypotheses. The majority die in early
infancy. A few live and are for a time widely
accepted. Then some new hypothesis either destroys them
completely or shows that, while they contain elements of
truth, they are not the whole truth. In the previous chapter
we have discussed a group of hypotheses of this kind,
and have tried to point out fairly their degree of truth so
far as it can yet be determined. In this chapter we shall
outline still another hypothesis, the relation of which to
present climatic conditions has been fully developed in
<em>Earth and Sun</em>; while its relation to the past will be explained
in the present volume. This hypothesis is not
supposed to supersede the others, for so far as they are
true they cannot be superseded. It merely seems to explain
some of the many conditions which the other
hypotheses apparently fail to explain. To suppose that
it will suffer a fate more glorious than its predecessors
would be presumptuous. The best that can be hoped is
that after it has been pruned, enriched, and modified, it
may take its place among the steps which finally lead to
the goal of truth.</p>

<p>In this chapter the new hypothesis will be sketched in
broad outline in order that in the rest of this book the
reader may appreciate the bearing of all that is said.
Details of proof and methods of work will be omitted,

since they are given in <em>Earth and Sun</em>. For the sake of
brevity and clearness the main conclusions will be stated
without the qualifications and exceptions which are fully
explained in that volume. Here it will be necessary to
pass quickly over points which depart radically from accepted
ideas, and which therefore must arouse serious
question in the minds of thoughtful readers. That, however,
is a necessary consequence of the attempt which
this book makes to put the problem of climate in such
form that the argument can be followed by thoughtful
students in any branch of knowledge and not merely by
specialists. Therefore, the specialist can merely be asked
to withhold judgment until he has read all the evidence
as given in <em>Earth and Sun</em>, and then to condemn only
those parts that are wrong and not the whole argument.</p>

<p>Without further explanation let us turn to our main
problem. In the realm of climatology the most important
discovery of the last generation is that variations in the
weather depend on variations in the activity of the sun's
atmosphere. The work of the great astronomer, Newcomb,
and that of the great climatologist, K&ouml;ppen, have
shown beyond question that the temperature of the
earth's surface varies in harmony with variations in the
number and area of sunspots.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="r15">[15]</a></sup> The work of Abbot has
shown that the amount of heat radiated from the sun also
varies, and that in general the variations correspond with
those of the sunspots, although there are exceptions,
especially when the spots are fewest. Here, however,
there at once arises a puzzling paradox. The earth certainly
<!--File: cc077.png Page 53-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_53" title="pg 53"></a>
owes its warmth to the sun. Yet when the sun emits
the most energy, that is, when sunspots are most numerous,
the earth's surface is coolest. Doubtless the earth
receives more heat than usual at such times, and the
upper air may be warmer than usual. Here we refer only
to the air at the earth's surface.</p>

<p>Another large group of investigators have shown that
atmospheric pressure also varies in harmony with the
number of sunspots. Some parts of the earth's surface
have one kind of variation at times of many sunspots and
other parts the reverse. These differences are systematic
and depend largely on whether the region in question
happens to have high atmospheric pressure or low. The
net result is that when sunspots are numerous the
earth's storminess increases, and the atmosphere is
thrown into commotion. This interferes with the stable
planetary winds, such as the trades of low latitudes and
the prevailing westerlies of higher latitudes. Instead of
these regular winds and the fair weather which they
bring, there is a tendency toward frequent tropical hurricanes
in the lower latitudes and toward more frequent
and severe storms of the ordinary type in the latitudes
where the world's most progressive nations now live.
With the change in storminess there naturally goes a
change in rainfall. Not all parts of the world, however,
have increased storminess and more abundant rainfall
when sunspots are numerous. Some parts change in the
opposite way. Thus when the sun's atmosphere is particularly
disturbed, the contrasts between different parts
of the earth's surface are increased. For example, the
northern United States and southern Canada become
more stormy and rainy, as appears in Fig. 2, and the
same is true of the Southwest and along the south Atlantic
coast. In a crescent-shaped central area, however,
<!--File: cc078.png Page 54-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_54" title="pg 54"></a>
extending from Wyoming through Missouri to Nova
Scotia, the number of storms and the amount of rainfall
decrease.</p>

maxima in the three sunspot cycles from 1888 to 1918. Heavy shading
indicates excess of storminess when sunspots are numerous. Figures indicate
average yearly number of storms by which years of maximum sunspots
exceed those of minimum sunspots.</p>

<p>The two controlling factors of any climate are the
temperature and the atmospheric pressure, for they determine
the winds, the storms, and thus the rainfall. A
study of the temperature seems to show that the peculiar
paradox of a hot sun and a cool earth is due largely to
the increased storminess during times of many sunspots.
The earth's surface is heated by the rays of the sun, but
<!--File: cc079.png Page 55-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_55" title="pg 55"></a>
most of the rays do not in themselves heat the air as
they pass through it. The air gets its heat largely from
the heat absorbed by the water vapor which is intimately
mingled with its lower portions, or from the long heat
waves sent out by the earth after it has been warmed by
the sun. The faster the air moves along the earth's surface
the less it becomes heated, and the more heat it takes
away. This sounds like a contradiction, but not to anyone
who has tried to heat a stove in the open air. If the air
is still, the stove rapidly becomes warm and so does the
air around it. If the wind is blowing, the cool air delays
the heating of the stove and prevents the surface from
ever becoming as hot as it would otherwise. That seems
to be what happens on a large scale when sunspots are
numerous. The sun actually sends to the earth more
energy than usual, but the air moves with such unusual
rapidity that it actually cools the earth's surface a trifle
by carrying the extra heat to high levels where it is lost
into space.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion as to why storms are
numerous when the sun's atmosphere is disturbed. Many
investigators have supposed it was due entirely and
directly to the heating of the earth's surface by the sun.
This, however, needs modification for several reasons.
In the first place, recent investigations show that in a
great many cases changes in barometric pressure precede
changes in temperature and apparently cause them by
altering the winds and producing storms. This is the
opposite of what would happen if the effect of solar heat
upon the earth's surface were the only agency. In the
second place, if storms were due exclusively to variations
in the ordinary solar radiation which comes to the earth
as light and is converted into heat, the solar effect ought
<!--File: cc080.png  Page 56-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_56" title="pg 56"></a>
to be most pronounced when the center of the sun's
visible disk is most disturbed. As a matter of fact the
storminess is notably greatest when the edges of the
solar disk are most disturbed. These facts and others lead
to the conclusion that some agency other than heat must
also play some part in producing storminess.</p>

<p>The search for this auxiliary agency raises many difficult
questions which cannot yet be answered. On the
whole the weight of evidence suggests that electrical
phenomena of some kind are involved, although variations
in the amount of ultra-violet light may also be
important. Many investigators have shown that the sun
emits electrons. Hale has proved that the sun, like the
earth, is magnetized. Sunspots also have magnetic fields
the strength of which is often fifty times as great as that
of the sun as a whole. If electrons are sent to the earth,
they must move in curved paths, for they are deflected
by the sun's magnetic field and again by the earth's
magnetic field. The solar deflection may cause their
effects to be greatest when the spots are near the sun's
margin; the terrestrial deflection may cause concentration
in bands roughly concentric with the magnetic poles
of the earth. These conditions correspond with the known
facts.</p>

<p>Farther than this we cannot yet go. The calculations of
Humphreys seem to indicate that the direct electrical
effect of the sun's electrons upon atmospheric pressure
is too small to be of appreciable significance in intensifying
storms. On the other hand the peculiar way in which
activity upon the margins of the sun appears to be correlated
not only with atmospheric electricity, but with
barometric pressure, seems to be equally strong evidence
in the other direction. Possibly the sun's electrons and
its electrical waves produce indirect effects by being
<!--File: cc081.png Page 57-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_57" title="pg 57"></a>
converted into heat, or by causing the formation of ozone
and the condensation of water vapor in the upper air.
Any one of these processes would raise the temperature
of the upper air, for the ozone and the water vapor would
be formed there and would tend to act as a blanket to
hold in the earth's heat. But any such change in the temperature
of the upper air would influence the lower air
through changes in barometric pressure. These considerations
are given here because the thoughtful reader
is likely to inquire how solar activity can influence
storminess. Moreover, at the end of this book we shall
take up certain speculative questions in which an electrical
hypothesis will be employed. For the main portions
of this book it makes no difference how the sun's
variations influence the earth's atmosphere. The only table 6
essential point is that when the solar atmosphere is active
the storminess of the earth increases, and that is a matter
of direct observation.</p>

<p>Let us now inquire into the relation between the small
cyclonic vacillations of the weather and the types of
climatic changes known as historic pulsations and glacial
fluctuations. One of the most interesting results of recent
investigations is the evidence that sunspot cycles on a
small scale present almost the same phenomena as do
historic pulsations and glacial fluctuations. For instance,
when sunspots are numerous, storminess increases
markedly in a belt near the northern border of the area
of greatest storminess, that is, in southern Canada and
thence across the Atlantic to the North Sea and Scandinavia.
(See Figs. 2 and 3.) Corresponding with this is the
fact that the evidence as to climatic pulsations in historic
times indicates that regions along this path, for instance
Greenland, the North Sea region, and southern Scandinavia,
<!--File: cc082.png Page 58-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_58" title="pg 58"></a>

<!--File: cc084.png Page 60-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_60" title="pg 60"></a>

were visited by especially frequent and severe
storms at the climax of each pulsation. Moreover, the
greatest accumulations of ice in the glacial period were
on the poleward border of the general regions where now
the storms appear to increase most at times of solar
activity.</p>

data from Walker: Sunspots and Rainfall.</p>

<p>Even more clear is the evidence from other regions
where storms increase at times of many sunspots. One
such region includes the southwestern United States,
while another is the Mediterranean region and the semi-arid
or desert parts of Asia farther east. In these regions
innumerable ruins and other lines of evidence show that
at the climax of each climatic pulsation there was more
storminess and rainfall than at present, just as there
now is when the sun is most active. In still earlier times,
while ice was accumulating farther north, the basins of
these semi-arid regions were filled with lakes whose
strands still remain to tell the tale of much-increased
rainfall and presumable storminess. If we go back still
further in geological times to the Permian glaciation, the
areas where ice accumulated most abundantly appear to
be the regions where tropical hurricanes produce the
greatest rainfall and the greatest lowering of temperature
at times of many sunspots. From these and many
other lines of evidence it seems probable that historic
pulsations and glacial fluctuations are nothing more than
sunspot cycles on a large scale. It is one of the fundamental
rules of science to reason from the known to the
unknown, from the near to the far, from the present to
the past. Hence it seems advisable to investigate whether
any of the climatic phenomena of the past may have
arisen from an intensification of the solar conditions
which now appear to give rise to similar phenomena on
a small scale.</p>
<p><!--File: cc085.png Page 61-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_61" title="pg 61"></a>
The rest of this chapter will be devoted to a <em>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</em>
of certain tentative conclusions which have no bearing
on the main part of this book, but which apply to the
closing chapters. There we shall inquire into the periodicity
of the climatic phenomena of geological times, and
shall ask whether there is any reason to suppose that the
sun's activity has exhibited similar periodicity. This
leads to an investigation of the possible causes of disturbances
in the sun's atmosphere. It is generally assumed
that sunspots, solar prominences, the bright clouds
known as facul&aelig;, and other phenomena denoting a perturbed
state of the solar atmosphere, are due to some
cause within the sun. Yet the limitation of these phenomena,
especially the sunspots, to restricted latitudes,
as has been shown in <em>Earth and Sun</em>, does not seem to be
in harmony with an internal solar origin, even though
a banded arrangement may be normal for a rotating
globe. The fairly regular periodicity of the sunspots
seems equally out of harmony with an internal origin.
Again, the solar atmosphere has two kinds of circulation,
one the so-called "rice grains," and the other
the spots and their attendant phenomena. Now the rice
grains present the appearance that would be expected in
an atmospheric circulation arising from the loss of heat
by the outer part of a gaseous body like the sun. For
these reasons and others numerous good thinkers from
Wolf to Schuster have held that sunspots owe their
periodicity to causes outside the sun. The only possible
cause seems to be the planets, acting either through
gravitation, through forces of an electrical origin, or
through some other agency. Various new investigations
which are described in <em>Earth and Sun</em> support this conclusion.
The chief difficulty in accepting it hitherto has
been that although Jupiter, because of its size, would be
<!--File: cc086.png Page 62-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_62" title="pg 62"></a>
expected to dominate the sunspot cycle, its period of
11.86 years has not been detected. The sunspot cycle has
appeared to average 11.2 years in length, and has been
called the 11-year cycle. Nevertheless, a new analysis of
the sunspot data shows that when attention is concentrated
upon the major maxima, which are least subject to
retardation or acceleration by other causes, a periodicity
closely approaching that of Jupiter is evident. Moreover,
when the effects of Jupiter, Saturn, and the other planets
are combined, they produce a highly variable curve which
has an extraordinary resemblance to the sunspot curve.
The method by which the planets influence the sun's
atmosphere is still open to question. It may be through
tides, through the direct effect of gravitation, through
electro-magnetic forces, or in some other way. Whichever
it may be, the result may perhaps be slight differences of
atmospheric pressure upon the sun. Such differences
may set in motion slight whirling movements analogous
to terrestrial storms, and these presumably gather momentum
from the sun's own energy. Since the planetary
influences vary in strength because of the continuous
change in the relative distances and positions of the
planets, the sun's atmosphere appears to be swayed by
cyclonic disturbances of varying degrees of severity. The
cyclonic disturbances known as sunspots have been
proved by Hale to become more highly electrified as they
increase in intensity. At the same time hot gases presumably
well up from the lower parts of the solar atmosphere
and thereby cause the sun to emit more heat. Thus
by one means or another, the earth's atmosphere appears
to be set in commotion and cycles of climate are inaugurated.</p>

<p>If the preceding reasoning is correct, any disturbance
of the solar atmosphere must have an effect upon the
<!--File: cc087.png Page 63-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_63" title="pg 63"></a>
earth's climate. If the disturbance were great enough and
of the right nature it might produce a glacial epoch. The
planets are by no means the only bodies which act upon
the sun, for that body sustains a constantly changing
relation to millions of other celestial bodies of all sizes
up to vast universes, and at all sorts of distances. If the
sun and another star should approach near enough to one
another, it is certain that the solar atmosphere would be
disturbed much more than at present.</p>

<p>Here we must leave the cyclonic hypothesis of climate
and must refer the reader once more to <em>Earth and Sun</em>
for fuller details. In the rest of this book we shall discuss
the nature of the climatic changes of past times and shall
inquire into their relation to the various climatic hypotheses
mentioned in the last two chapters. Then we shall
inquire into the possibility that the solar system has ever
been near enough to any of the stars to cause appreciable
disturbances of the solar atmosphere. We shall complete
our study by investigating the vexed question of why
movements of the earth's crust, such as the uplifting of
continents and mountain chains, have generally occurred
at the same time as great climatic fluctuations. This
would not be so surprising were it not that the climatic
phenomena appear to have consisted of highly complex
cycles while the uplift has been a relatively steady movement
in one direction. We shall find some evidence that
the solar disturbances which seem to cause climatic
changes also have a relation to movements of the crust.</p>

<h3>THE CLIMATE OF HISTORY<sup><a href="#fn16" id="r16">[16]</a></sup></h3>


<p>We are now prepared to consider the climate of
the past. The first period to claim attention is
the few thousand years covered by written
history. Strangely enough, the conditions during this
time are known with less accuracy than are those of
geological periods hundreds of times more remote. Yet
if pronounced changes have occurred since the days of
the ancient Babylonians and since the last of the post-glacial
stages, they are of great importance not only
because of their possible historic effects, but because they
bridge the gap between the little variations of climate
which are observable during a single lifetime and the
great changes known as glacial epochs. Only by bridging
the gap can we determine whether there is any genetic
relation between the great changes and the small. A full
discussion of the climate of historic times is not here
advisable, for it has been considered in detail in numerous
other publications.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="r17">[17]</a></sup> Our most profitable course would
seem to be to consider first the general trend of opinion
and then to take up the chief objections to each of the
main hypotheses.</p>

<p>In the hot debate over this problem during recent
<!--File: cc089.png Page 65-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_65" title="pg 65"></a>
decades the ideas of geographers seem to have gone
through much the same metamorphosis as have those of
geologists in regard to the climate of far earlier times.</p>

<p>As every geologist well knows, at the dawn of geology
people believed in climatic uniformity&mdash;that is, it was
supposed that since the completion of an original creative
act there had been no important changes. This view
quickly disappeared and was superseded by the hypothesis
of progressive cooling and drying, an hypothesis
which had much to do with the development of the nebular
hypothesis, and which has in turn been greatly
strengthened by that hypothesis. The discovery of evidence
of widespread continental glaciation, however,
necessitated a modification of this view, and succeeding
years have brought to light a constantly increasing number
of glacial, or at least cool, periods distributed
throughout almost the whole of geological time. Moreover,
each year, almost, brings new evidence of the great
complexity of glacial periods, epochs, and stages. Thus,
for many decades, geologists have more and more been
led to believe that in spite of surprising uniformity, when
viewed in comparison with the cosmic possibilities, the
climate of the past has been highly unstable from the
viewpoint of organic evolution, and its changes have been
of all degrees of intensity.</p>

<p>Geographers have lately been debating the reality of
historic changes of climate in the same way in which
geologists debated the reality of glacial epochs and
stages. Several hypotheses present themselves but these
may all be grouped under three headings; namely, the
hypotheses of (1) progressive desiccation, (2) climatic
uniformity, and (3) pulsations. The hypothesis of progressive
desiccation has been widely advocated. In many
of the drier portions of the world, especially between 30&deg;
<!--File: cc090.png Page 66-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_66" title="pg 66"></a>
and 40&deg; from the equator, and pre&euml;minently in western
and central Asia and in the southwestern United States,
almost innumerable facts seem to indicate that two or
three thousand years ago the climate was distinctly
moister than at present. The evidence includes old lake
strands, the traces of desiccated springs, roads in places
now too dry for caravans, other roads which make detours
around dry lake beds where no lakes now exist, and
fragments of dead forests extending over hundreds of
square miles where trees cannot now grow for lack of
water. Still stronger evidence is furnished by ancient
ruins, hundreds of which are located in places which are
now so dry that only the merest fraction of the former
inhabitants could find water. The ruins of Palmyra, in
the Syrian Desert, show that it must once have been a
city like modern Damascus, with one or two hundred
thousand inhabitants, but its water supply now suffices
for only one or two thousand. All attempts to increase the
water supply have had only a slight effect and the water
is notoriously sulphurous, whereas in the former days,
when it was abundant, it was renowned for its excellence.
Hundreds of pages might be devoted to describing similar
ruins. Some of them are even more remarkable for
their dryness than is Niya, a site in the Tarim Desert of
Chinese Turkestan. Yet there the evidence of desiccation
within 2000 years is so strong that even so careful and
conservative a man as Hann,<sup><a href="#fn18" id="r18">[18]</a></sup> pronounces it "&uuml;berzeugend."</p>

<p>A single quotation from scores that might be used will
illustrate the conclusions of some of the most careful
arch&aelig;ologists.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="r19">[19]</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the regions which were once populous and highly
civilized, but which are now desert and deserted, there are few
which were more closely connected with the beginnings of our
own civilization than the desert parts of Syria and northern
Arabia. It is only of recent years that the vast extent and great
importance of this lost civilization has been fully recognized and
that attempts have been made to reduce the extent of the unexplored
area and to discover how much of the territory which has
long been known as desert was formerly habitable and inhabited.
The results of the explorations of the last twenty years have been
most astonishing in this regard. It has been found that practically
all of the wide area lying between the coast range of the
eastern Mediterranean and the Euphrates, appearing upon the
maps as the Syrian Desert, an area embracing somewhat more
than 20,000 square miles, was more thickly populated than any
area of similar dimensions in England or in the United States
is today if one excludes the immediate vicinity of the large
modern cities. It has also been discovered that an enormous
desert tract lying to the east of Palestine, stretching eastward
and southward into the country which we know as Arabia, was
also a densely populated country. How far these settled regions
extended in antiquity is still unknown, but the most distant
explorations in these directions have failed to reach the end of
ruins and other signs of former occupation.</p>

<p>The traveler who has crossed the settled, and more or less
populous, coast range of northern Syria and descended into the
narrow fertile valley of the Orontes, encounters in any farther
journey toward the east an irregular range of limestone hills
lying north and south and stretching to the northeast almost
halfway to the Euphrates. These hills are about 2,500 feet high,
rising in occasional peaks from 3,000 to 3,500 feet above sea level.
They are gray and unrelieved by any visible vegetation. On
ascending into the hills the traveler is astonished to find at every
turn remnants of the work of men's hands, paved roads, walls
which divided fields, terrace walls of massive structure. Presently
he comes upon a small deserted and partly ruined town
<!--File: cc092.png Page 68-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_68" title="pg 68"></a>
composed of buildings large and small constructed of beautifully
wrought blocks of limestone, all rising out of the barren
rock which forms the ribs of the hills. If he mounts an eminence
in the vicinity, he will be still further astonished to behold
similar ruins lying in all directions. He may count ten or fifteen
or twenty, according to the commanding position of his lookout.
From a distance it is often difficult to believe that these are not
inhabited places; but closer inspection reveals that the gentle
hand of time or the rude touch of earthquake has been laid upon
every building. Some of the towns are better preserved than
others; some buildings are quite perfect but for their wooden
roofs which time has removed, others stand in picturesque ruins,
while others still are level with the ground. On a far-off hilltop
stands the ruin of a pagan temple, and crowning some lofty ridge
lie the ruins of a great Christian monastery. Mile after mile of
this barren gray country may be traversed without encountering
a single human being. Day after day may be spent in traveling
from one ruined town to another without seeing any green
thing save a terebinth tree or two standing among the ruins,
which have sent their roots down into earth still preserved in
the foundations of some ancient building. No soil is visible
anywhere except in a few pockets in the rock from which it
could not be washed by the torrential rains of the wet season;
yet every ruin is surrounded with the remains of presses for the
making of oil and wine. Only one oasis has been discovered in
these high plateaus.</p>

<p>Passing eastward from this range of hills, one descends into a
gently rolling country that stretches miles away toward the
Euphrates. At the eastern foot of the hills one finds oneself in a
totally different country, at first quite fertile and dotted with
frequent villages of flat-roofed houses. Here practically all the
remains of ancient times have been destroyed through ages of
building and rebuilding. Beyond this narrow fertile strip the
soil grows drier and more barren, until presently another kind
of desert is reached, an undulating waste of dead soil. Few walls
or towers or arches rise to break the monotony of the unbroken
<!--File: cc093.png Page 69-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_69" title="pg 69"></a>
landscape; but the careful explorer will find on closer examination
that this region was more thickly populated in antiquity
even than the hill country to the west. Every unevenness of the
surface marks the site of a town, some of them cities of considerable
extent.</p>

<p>We may draw certain very definite conclusions as to the
former conditions of the country itself. There was soil upon the
northern hills where none now exists, for the buildings now show
unfinished foundation courses which were not intended to be
seen; the soil in depressions without outlets is deeper than it
formerly was; there are hundreds of olive and wine presses in
localities where no tree or vine could now find footing; and
there are hillsides with ruined terrace walls rising one above
the other with no sign of earth near them. There was also a large
natural water supply. In the north as well as in the south we
find the dry beds of rivers, streams, and brooks with sand and
pebbles and well-worn rocks but no water in them from one
year's end to the other. We find bridges over these dry streams
and crudely made washing boards along their banks directly
below deserted towns. Many of the bridges span the beds of
streams that seldom or never have water in them and give
clear evidence of the great climatic changes that have taken
place. There are well heads and well houses, and inscriptions
referring to springs; but neither wells nor springs exist today
except in the rarest instances. Many of the houses had their
rock-hewn cisterns, never large enough to have supplied water
for more than a brief period, and corresponding to the cisterns
which most of our recent forefathers had which were for convenience
rather than for dependence. Some of the towns in
southern Syria were provided with large public reservoirs, but
these are not large enough to have supplied water to their
original populations. The high plateaus were of course without
irrigation; but there are no signs, even in the lower flatter
country, that irrigation was ever practiced; and canals for this
purpose could not have completely disappeared. There were
forests in the immediate vicinity, forests producing timbers of
great length and thickness; for in the north and northeast practically
<!--File: cc094.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_70" title="pg 70"></a>
 all the buildings had wooden roofs, wooden intermediate
floors, and other features of wood. Costly buildings, such as
temples and churches, employed large wooden beams; but wood
was used in much larger quantities in private dwellings, shops,
stables, and barns. If wood had not been plentiful and cheap&mdash;which
means grown near by&mdash;the builders would have adopted
the building methods of their neighbors in the south, who used
very little wood and developed the most perfect type of lithic
architecture the world has ever seen. And here there exists a
strange anomaly: Northern Syria, where so much wood was
employed in antiquity, is absolutely treeless now; while in the
mountains of southern Syria, where wood must have been
scarce in antiquity to have forced upon the inhabitants an almost
exclusive use of stone, there are still groves of scrub oak and
pine, and travelers of half a century ago reported large forests
of chestnut trees.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="r20">[20]</a></sup> It is perfectly apparent that large parts of
Syria once had soil and forests and springs and rivers, while it
has none of these now, and that it had a much larger and better
distributed rainfall in ancient times than it has now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor Butler's careful work is especially interesting
because of its contrast to the loose statements of
those who believe in climatic uniformity. So far as I am
aware, no opponent of the hypothesis of climatic changes
has ever even attempted to show by careful statistical
analysis that the ancient water supply of such ruins was
no greater than that of the present. The most that has
been done is to suggest that there may have been sources
of water which are now unknown. Of course, this might
be true in a single instance, but it could scarcely be the
case in many hundreds or thousands of ruins.</p>

<!--File: cc095.png Page 71-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_71" title="pg 71"></a>

<p>Although the arguments in favor of a change of climate
during the last two thousand years seem too strong
to be ignored, their very strength seems to have been a
source of error. A large number of people have jumped
to the conclusion that the change which appears to have
occurred in certain regions occurred everywhere, and
that it consisted of a gradual desiccation.</p>

<p>Many observers, quite as careful as those who believe
in progressive desiccation, point to evidences of aridity
in past times in the very regions where the others find
proof of moisture. Lakes such as the Caspian Sea fell to
such a low level that parts of their present floors were
exposed and were used as sites for buildings whose ruins
are still extant. Elsewhere, for instance in the Tian-Shan
Mountains, irrigation ditches are found in places where
irrigation never seems to be necessary at present. In
Syria and North Africa during the early centuries of the
Christian era the Romans showed unparalleled activity
in building great aqueducts and in watering land which
then apparently needed water almost as much as it does
today. Evidence of this sort is abundant and is as convincing
as is the evidence of moister conditions in the
past. It is admirably set forth, for example, in the comprehensive
and ably written monograph of Leiter on the
climate of North Africa.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="r21">[21]</a></sup> The evidence cited there and
elsewhere has led many authors strongly to advocate the
hypothesis of climatic uniformity. They have done exactly
as have the advocates of progressive change, and
have extended their conclusions over the whole world and
over the whole of historic times.</p>

<p>The hypotheses of climatic uniformity and of progressive
<!--File: cc096.png Pag2 72-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_72" title="pg 72"></a>
change both seem to be based on reliable evidence.
They may seem to be diametrically opposed to one
another, but this is only when there is a failure to group
the various lines of evidence according to their dates, and
according to the types of climate in which they happen
to be located. When the facts are properly grouped in
both time and space, it appears that evidence of moist
conditions in the historic Mediterranean lands is found
during certain periods; for instance, four or five hundred
years before Christ, at the time of Christ, and 1000 A. D.
The other kind of evidence, on the contrary, culminates
at other epochs, such as about 1200 B. C. and in the
seventh and thirteenth centuries after Christ. It is also
found during the interval from the culmination of a moist
epoch to the culmination of a dry one, for at such times
the climate was growing drier and the people were under
stress. This was seemingly the case during the period
from the second to the fourth centuries of our era. North
Africa and Syria must then have been distinctly better
watered than at present, as appears from Butler's vivid
description; but they were gradually becoming drier, and
the natural effect on a vigorous, competent people like the
Romans was to cause them to construct numerous engineering
works to provide the necessary water.</p>

<p>The considerations which have just been set forth have
led to a third hypothesis, that of pulsatory climatic
changes. According to this, the earth's climate is not
stable, nor does it change uniformly in one direction. It
appears to fluctuate back and forth not only in the little
waves which we see from year to year or decade to
decade, but in much larger waves, which take hundreds of
years or even a thousand. These in turn seem to merge
into and be imposed on the greater waves which form
glacial stages, glacial epochs, and glacial periods. At the
<!--File: cc097.png Page 73-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_73" title="pg 73"></a>
present time there seems to be no way of determining
whether the general tendency is toward aridity or toward
glaciation. The seventh century of our era was apparently
the driest time during the historic period&mdash;distinctly
drier than the present&mdash;but the thirteenth century was
almost equally dry, and the twelfth or thirteenth before
Christ may have been very dry.</p>

<p>The best test of an hypothesis is actual measurements.
In the case of the pulsatory hypothesis we are fortunately
able to apply this test by means of trees. The
growth of vegetation depends on many factors&mdash;soil, exposure,
wind, sun, temperature, rain, and so forth. In a
dry region the most critical factor in determining how a
tree's growth shall vary from year to year is the supply
of moisture during the few months of most rapid
growth.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="r22">[22]</a></sup>
The work of Douglass<sup><a href="#fn23" id="r23">[23]
</a></sup> and others has shown
that in Arizona and California the thickness of the
annual rings affords a reliable indication of the amount
of moisture available during the period of growth. This
is especially true when the growth of several years is
taken as the unit and is compared with the growth of
a similar number of years before or after. Where a long
series of years is used, it is necessary to make corrections
to eliminate the effects of age, but this can be done by
mathematical methods of considerable accuracy. It is
difficult to determine whether the climate at the beginning
<!--File: cc098.png Page 74-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_74" title="pg 74"></a>
and end of a tree's life was the same, but it is easily possible
to determine whether there have been pulsations
while the tree was making its growth. If a large number
of trees from various parts of a given district all formed
thick rings at a certain period and then formed thin ones
for a hundred years, after which the rings again become
thick, we seem to be safe in concluding that the trees have
lived through a long, dry period. The full reasons for this
belief and details as to the methods of estimating climate
from tree growth are given in <em>The Climatic Factor</em>.</p>

<p>The results set forth in that volume may be summarized
as follows: During the years 1911 and 1912, under
the auspices of the Carnegie Institution of Washington,
measurements were made of the thickness of the rings of
growth on the stumps of about 450 sequoia trees in California.
These trees varied in age from 250 to nearly
3250 years. The great majority were over 1000 years of
age, seventy-nine were over 2000 years, and three over
3000. Even where only a few trees are available the
record is surprisingly reliable, except where occasional
accidents occur. Where the number approximates 100,
accidental variations are largely eliminated and we may
accept the record with considerable confidence. Accordingly,
we may say that in California we have a fairly
accurate record of the climate for 2000 years and an
approximate record for 1000 years more. The final results
of the measurements of the California trees are
shown in Fig. 4, where the climatic variations for 3000
years in California are indicated by the solid line. The
high parts of the line indicate rainy conditions, the low
parts, dry. An examination of this curve shows that
during 3000 years there have apparently been climatic
variations more important than any which have taken
place during the past century. In order to bring out the

<!--File: cc100.png Page 76-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_76" title="pg 76"></a>
details more clearly, the more reliable part of the California
curve, from 100 B. C. to the present time, has been
reproduced in Fig. 5. This is identical with the corresponding
part of Fig. 4, except that the vertical scale is
three times as great.</p>
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="800" height="192" alt="Fig. 4"  id="Fig_4" />
<p class="center"><em>Fig. 4. Changes of climate in California (solid line) and in western and
central Asia (dotted line).</em></p>

<p class="blockquot">Note. The curves of Figs. 4 and 5 are reproduced as published in <em>The Solar Hypothesis</em> in 1914. Later work,
however, has indicated that in the Asiatic curve the dash lines, which were tentatively inserted in 1914, are
probably more nearly correct than the dotted lines. Still further evidence indicates that the Asiatic curve is
nearly like that of California in its main features.</p>

<p>The curve of tree growth in California seems to be a
true representation of the general features of climatic
pulsations in the Mediterranean region. This conclusion
was originally based on the resemblance between the
solid line of Fig. 4, representing tree growth, and the
dotted line representing changes of climate in the eastern
Mediterranean region as inferred from the study of ruins
and of history before any work on this subject had been
done in America.<sup><a href="#fn24" id="r24">[24]</a></sup> The dotted line is here reproduced for
its historical significance as a stage in the study of climatic
changes. If it were to be redrawn today on the
basis of the knowledge acquired in the last twelve years,
it would be much more like the tree curve. For example,
the period of aridity suggested by the dip of the dotted
line about 300 A. D. was based largely on Professor
Butler's data as to the paucity of inscriptions and ruins
dating from that period in Syria. In the recent article,
from which a long quotation has been given, he shows
that later work proves that there is no such paucity. On
the other hand, it has accentuated the marked and sudden
decay in civilization and population which occurred
shortly after 600 A. D. He reached the same conclusion
to which the present authors had come on wholly different
grounds, namely, that the dip in the dotted line about 300
A. D. is not warranted, whereas the dip about 630 A. D.
is extremely important. In similar fashion the work of

Stein<sup><a href="#fn25" id="r25">[25]</a></sup> in central Asia makes it clear that the contrast
between the water supply about 200 B. C. and in the preceding
and following centuries was greater than was
supposed on the basis of the scanty evidence available
when the dotted line of Fig. 4 was drawn in 1910.</p>
<img src="images/fig5.png" width="800" height="294" alt="Fig. 5"  id="Fig_5" />
<p class="center"><em>Fig. 5. Changes in California climate for 2000 years, as measured by
growth of Sequoia trees.</em></p>

<p class="blockquot">Fig. 5 is the same as the later portion of Fig. 4, except that the vertical scale has been magnified threefold.
It seems probable that the dotted line at the right is more nearly correct than the solid line. During the thirty
years since the end of the curve the general tendency appears in general to have been somewhat upward.</p>

<p>Since the curve of the California trees is the only continuous
and detailed record yet available for the climate
of the last three thousand years, it deserves most careful
study. It is especially necessary to determine the degree
of accuracy with which the growth of the trees represents
(1) the local rainfall and (2) the rainfall of remote
regions such as Palestine. Perhaps the best way to determine
these matters is the standard mathematical method
of correlation coefficients. If two phenomena vary in
perfect unison, as in the case of the turning of the wheels
and the progress of an automobile when the brakes are
not applied, the correlation coefficient is 1.00, being positive
when the automobile goes forward and negative
when it goes backward. If there is no relation between
two phenomena, as in the case of the number of miles run
by a given automobile each year and the number of
chickens hatched in the same period, the coefficient is
zero. A partial relationship where other factors enter
into the matter is represented by a coefficient between
zero and one, as in the case of the movement of the automobile
and the consumption of gasoline. In this case the
relation is very obvious, but is modified by other factors,
including the roughness and grade of the road, the
amount of traffic, the number of stops, the skill of the
driver, the condition and load of the automobile, and the
state of the weather. Such partial relationships are the
kind for which correlation coefficients are most useful,
for the size of the coefficients shows the relative importance
<!--File: cc103.png Page 79-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_79" title="pg 79"></a>
of the various factors. A correlation coefficient
four times the probable error, which can always be determined
by a formula well known to mathematicians, is
generally considered to afford evidence of some kind of
relation between two phenomena. When the ratio between
coefficient and error rises to six, the relationship is regarded
as strong.</p>

<p>Few people would question that there is a connection
between tree growth and rainfall, especially in a climate
with a long summer dry season like that of California.
But the growth of the trees also depends on their position,
the amount of shading, the temperature, insect pests,
blights, the wind with its tendency to break the branches,
and a number of other factors. Moreover, while rain
commonly favors growth, great extremes are relatively
less helpful than more moderate amounts. Again, the
roots of a tree may tap such deep sources of water that
neither drought nor excessive rain produces much effect
for several years. Hence in comparing the growth of the
huge sequoias with the rainfall we should expect a correlation
coefficient high enough to be convincing, but decidedly
below 1.00. Unfortunately there is no record of
the rainfall where the sequoias grow, the nearest long
record being that of Sacramento, nearly 200 miles to the
northwest and close to sea level instead of at an altitude
of about 6000 feet.</p>

<p>Applying the method of correlation coefficients to the
annual rainfall of Sacramento and the growth of the
sequoias from 1863 to 1910, we obtain the results shown
in Table 3. The trees of Section A of the table grew in
moderately dry locations although the soil was fairly
deep, a condition which seems to be essential to sequoias.
In this case, as in all the others, the rainfall is reckoned
from July to June, which practically means from October
to May, since there is almost no summer rain. Thus the
tree growth in 1861 is compared with the rainfall of the
preceding rainy season, 1860-1861, or of several preceding
rainy seasons as the table indicates.</p>

<p>In the first line of Section A a correlation coefficient
of only -0.056, which is scarcely six-tenths of the probable
error, means that there is no appreciable relation
between the rainfall of a given season and the growth
during the following spring and summer. The roots of
the sequoias probably penetrate so deeply that the rain
and melted snow of the spring months do not sink down
rapidly enough to influence the trees before the growing
season comes to an end. The precipitation of two preceding
seasons, however, has some effect on the trees, as
appears in the second line of Section A, where the correlation
coefficient is +0.288, or 3.2 times the probable
error. When the rainfall of three seasons is taken into
account the coefficient rises to +0.570, or 8.7 times the
probable error, while with four years of rainfall the coefficient
begins to fall off. Thus the growth of these eighteen
sequoias on relatively dry slopes appears to have depended
chiefly on the rainfall of the second and third
preceding rainy seasons. The growth in 1900, for
example, depended largely on the rainfall in the rainy
seasons of 1897-1898 and 1898-1899.</p>

<p>Section B of the table shows that with 112 trees, growing
chiefly in moist depressions where the water supply
is at a maximum, the correlation between growth and
rainfall, +0.577 for ten years' rainfall, is even higher
than with the dry trees. The seepage of the underground
water is so slow that not until four years' rainfall is
taken into account is the correlation coefficient more than
four times the probable error. When only the trees growing
in moist locations are employed, the coefficient between
<!--File: cc106.png Page 82-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_82" title="pg 82"></a>
tree growth and the rainfall for ten years rises to
the high figure of +0.605, or 9.8 times the probable error,
as appears in Section C. These figures, as well as many
others not here published, make it clear that the curve of
sequoia growth from 1861 to 1910 affords a fairly close
indication of the rainfall at Sacramento, provided allowance
be made for a delay of three to ten years due to the
fact that the moisture in the soil gradually seeps down
the mountain-sides and only reaches the sequoias after a
considerable interval.</p>

<p>If a rainfall record were available for the place where
the trees actually grow, the relationship would probably
be still closer.</p>

<p>The record at Fresno, for example, bears out this conclusion
so far as it goes. But as Fresno lies at a low altitude
and its rainfall is of essentially the Sacramento
type, its short record is of less value than that of Sacramento.
The only rainfall records among the Sierras at
high levels, where the rainfall and temperature are approximately
like those of the sequoia region, are found
along the main line of the Southern Pacific railroad. This
runs from Oakland northeastward seventy miles across
the open plain to Sacramento, then another seventy miles,
as the crow flies, through Colfax and over a high pass
in the Sierras at Summit, next twenty miles or so down
through Truckee to Boca, on the edge of the inland basin
of Nevada, and on northeastward another 160 miles to
Winnemucca, where it turns east toward Ogden and Salt
Lake City. Section D of Table 3 shows the correlation
coefficients between the rainfall along the railroad and
the growth of the sequoias. At Sacramento, which lies
fairly open to winds from the Pacific and thus represents
the general climate of central California, the coefficient
is nearly five times the probable error, thus indicating a
<!--File: cc107.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_83" title="pg 83"></a>
real relation to sequoia growth. Then among the foothills
of the Sierras at Colfax, the coefficient drops till it is
scarcely larger than the probable error. It rises rapidly,
however, as one advances among the mountains, until at
Boca it attains the high figure of +0.604 or eight times
the probable error, and continues high in the dry area
farther east. In other words the growth of the sequoias
is a good indication of the rainfall where the trees grow
and in the dry region farther east.</p>

<p>In order to determine the degree to which the sequoia
record represents the rainfall of other regions, let us
select Jerusalem for comparison. The reasons for this
selection are that Jerusalem furnishes the only available
record that satisfies the following necessary conditions:
(1) its record is long enough to be important; (2) it is
located fairly near the latitude of the sequoias, 32&deg;N
versus 37&deg;N; (3) it is located in a similar type of climate
with winter rains and a long dry summer; (4) it lies well
above sea level (2500 feet) and somewhat back from the
seacoast, thus approximating although by no means
duplicating the condition of the sequoias; and (5) it lies
in a region where the evidence of climatic changes during
historic times is strongest. The ideal place for comparison
would be the valley in which grow the cedars of Lebanon.
Those trees resemble the sequoias to an extraordinary
degree, not only in their location, but in their great age.
Some day it will be most interesting to compare the
growth of these two famous groups of old trees.</p>

<p>The correlation coefficients for the sequoia growth
and the rainfall at Jerusalem are given in Section A,
Table 4. They are so high and so consistent that they
scarcely leave room for doubt that where a hundred or
more sequoias are employed, as in Fig. 5, their curve of
growth affords a good indication of the fluctuations of
climate in western Asia. The high coefficient for the
eleven trees measured by Douglass suggests that where
the number of trees falls as low as ten, as in the part of
Fig. 4 from 710 to 840 B. C., the relation between tree
growth and rainfall is still close even when only one
year's growth is considered. Where the unit is ten years
of growth, as in Figs. 4 and 5, the accuracy of the tree
curve as a measure of rainfall is much greater than when
a single year is used as in Table 4. When the unit is
raised to thirty years, as in the smoothed part of Fig. 4
previous to 240 B. C., even four trees, as from 960 to
1070, probably give a fair approximation to the general
changes in rainfall, while a single tree prior to 1110 B. C.
gives a rough indication.</p>

<p>Table 4 shows a peculiar feature in the fact that the
correlations of Section A between tree growth and the
rainfall of Jerusalem are decidedly higher than those
between the rainfall in the two regions. Only at Sacramento
and Boca are the rainfall coefficients high enough
to be conclusive. This, however, is not surprising, for
even between Sacramento and San Bernardino, only 400
miles apart, the correlation coefficient for the rainfall
by three-year periods is only 10.7 times the probable
error, as appears in Section C of Table 4, while between
San Bernardino and Winnemucca 500 miles away, the
corresponding figure drops to 2.8. It must be remembered
that in some respects the growth of the sequoias is
a much better record of rainfall than are the records kept
by man. The human record is based on the amount of
water caught by a little gauge a few inches in diameter.
Every gust of wind detracts from the accuracy of the
record; a mile away the rainfall may be double what it
is at the gauge. Each sequoia, on the other hand, draws
its moisture from an area thousands of times as large as
<!--File: cc110.png Page 86-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_86" title="pg 86"></a>
a rain gauge. Moreover, the trees on which Figs. 4 and 5
are based were scattered over an area fifty miles long
and several hundred square miles in extent. Hence they
represent the summation of the rainfall over an area
millions of times as large as that of a rain gauge. This
fact and the large correlation coefficients between sequoia
growth and Jerusalem rainfall should be considered in
connection with the fact that all the coefficients between
the rainfall of California and Nevada and that of Jerusalem
are positive. If full records of the complete rainfall
of California and Nevada on the one hand and of the
eastern Mediterranean region on the other were available
for a long period, they would probably agree closely.</p>

<p>Just how widely the sequoias can be used as a measure
of the climate of the past is not yet certain. In some
regions, as will shortly be explained, the climatic changes
seem to have been of an opposite character from those
of California. In others the Californian or eastern Mediterranean
type of change seems sometimes to prevail but
is not always evident. For example, at Malta the rainfall
today shows a distinct relation to that of Jerusalem and
to the growth of the sequoias. But the correlation coefficient
between the rainfall of eight-year periods at Naples,
a little farther north, and the growth of the sequoias at
the end of the periods is -0.132, or only 1.4 times the
probable error and much too small to be significant. This
is in harmony with the fact that although Naples has
summer droughts, they are not so pronounced as in California
and Palestine, and the prevalence of storms is
much greater. Jerusalem receives only 8 per cent of its
rain in the seven months from April to October, and
Sacramento 13, while Malta receives 31 per cent and
Naples 43. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that in
the past the climatic fluctuations of southern Italy followed
<!--File: cc111.png Page 87-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_87" title="pg 87"></a>
nearly the same course as those of California and
Palestine. This apparent discrepancy seems to be explained
by our previous conclusion that changes of climate
are due largely to a shifting of storm tracks. When
sunspots are numerous the storms which now prevail in
northern Italy seem to be shifted southward and traverse
the Mediterranean to Palestine just as similar storms
are shifted southward in the United States. This perhaps
accounts for the agreement between the sequoia curve
and the agricultural and social history of Rome from
about 400 B. C. to 100 A. D., as explained in <em>World Power
and Evolution</em>. For our present purposes, however, the
main point is that since rainfall records have been kept
the fluctuations of climate indicated by the growth of the
sequoias have agreed closely with fluctuations in the
rainfall of the eastern Mediterranean region. Presumably
the same was true in the past. In that case, the sequoia
curve not only is a good indication of climatic changes or
pulsations in regions of similar climate, but may serve
as a guide to coincident but different changes in regions
of other types.</p>

<p>An enormous body of other evidence points to the same
conclusion. It indicates that while the average climate
of the present is drier than that of the past in regions
having the Mediterranean type of winter rains and
summer droughts, there have been pronounced pulsations
during historic times so that at certain times there has
actually been greater aridity than at present. This conclusion
is so important that it seems advisable to examine
the only important arguments that have been raised
against it, especially against the idea that the general
rainfall of the eastern Mediterranean was greater in the
historic past than at present. The first objection is the
unquestionable fact that droughts and famines have
<!--File: cc112.png Page 88-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_88" title="pg 88"></a>
occurred at periods which seem on other evidence to have
been moister than the present. This argument has been
much used, but it seems to have little force. If the rainfall
of a given region averages thirty inches and varies
from fifteen to forty-five, a famine will ensue if the rainfall
drops for a few years to the lower limit and does not
rise much above twenty for a few years. If the climate of
the place changes during the course of centuries, so that
the rainfall averages only twenty inches, and ranges
from seven to thirty-five, famine will again ensue if the
rainfall remains near ten inches for a few years. The
ravages of the first famine might be as bad as those of
the second. They might even be worse, because when the
rainfall is larger the population is likely to be greater
and the distress due to scarcity of food would affect a
larger number of people. Hence historic records of
famines and droughts do not indicate that the climate
was either drier or moister than at present. They merely
show that at the time in question the climate was drier
than the normal for that particular period.</p>

<p>The second objection is that deserts existed in the past
much as at present. This is not a real objection, however,
for, as we shall see more fully, some parts of the world
suffer one kind of change and others quite the opposite.
Moreover, deserts have always existed, and when we talk
of a change in their climate we merely mean that their
boundaries have shifted. A concrete example of the mistaken
use of ancient dryness as proof of climatic uniformity
is illustrated by the march of Alexander from
India to Mesopotamia. Hedin gives an excellent presentation
of the case in the second volume of his <em>Overland
to India</em>. He shows conclusively that Alexander's army
suffered terribly from lack of water and provisions. This
certainly proves that the climate was dry, but it by no
<!--File: cc113.png Page 89-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_89" title="pg 89"></a>
means indicates that there has been no change from the
past to the present. We do not know whether Alexander's
march took place during an especially dry or an especially
wet year. In a desert region like Makran, in
southern Persia and Beluchistan, where the chief difficulties
occurred, the rainfall varies greatly from year to
year. We have no records from Makran, but the conditions
there are closely similar to those of southern
Arizona and New Mexico. In 1885 and 1905 the rainfall
for five stations in that region was as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>These stations are distributed over an area nearly 500
miles east and west. Manifestly a traveler who spent the
year 1885 in that region would have had much more difficulty
in finding water and forage than one who traveled
in the same places in 1905. During 1885 the rainfall was
42 per cent less than the average, and during 1905 it was
134 per cent more than the average. Let us suppose, for
the sake of argument, that the average rainfall of southeastern
Persia is six inches today and was ten inches in
the days of Alexander. If the rainfall from year to year
varied as much in the past in Persia as it does now in
New Mexico and Arizona, the rainfall during an ancient
<!--File: cc114.png Page 90-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_90" title="pg 90"></a>
dry year, corresponding in character to 1885, would have
been about 5.75 inches. On the other hand, if we suppose
that the rainfall then averaged less than at present,&mdash;let
us say four inches,&mdash;a wet year corresponding to 1905 in
the American deserts might have had a rainfall of about
ten inches. This being the case, it is clear that our estimate
of what Alexander's march shows as to climate
must depend largely on whether 325 B. C. was a wet year
or a dry year. Inasmuch as we know nothing about this,
we must fall back on the fact that a large army accomplished
a journey in a place where today even a small
caravan usually finds great difficulty in procuring forage
and water. Moreover, elephants were taken 180 miles
across what is now an almost waterless desert, and yet
the old historians make no comment on such a feat which
today would be practically impossible. These things seem
more in harmony with a change of climate than with
uniformity. Nevertheless, it is not safe to place much
reliance on them except when they are taken in conjunction
with other evidence, such as the numerous ruins,
which show that Makran was once far more densely
populated than now seems possible. Taken by itself, such
incidents as Alexander's march cannot safely be used
either as an argument for or against changes of climate.</p>

<p>The third and strongest objection to any hypothesis
of climatic changes during historic times is based on
vegetation. The whole question is admirably set forth by
J. W. Gregory,<sup><a href="#fn29" id="r29">[29]</a>
</sup> who gives not only his own results, but
those of the ablest scholars who have preceded him. His
conclusions are important because they represent one of
the few cases where a definite statistical attempt has been
made to prove the exact condition of the climate of the
<!--File: cc115.png Page 91-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_91" title="pg 91"></a>
past. After stating various less important reasons for
believing that the climate of Palestine has not changed,
he discusses vegetation. The following quotation indicates
his line of thought. A sentence near the beginning
is italicized in order to call attention to the importance
which Gregory and others lay on this particular kind of
evidence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some more certain test is necessary than the general conclusions
which can be based upon the historical and geographical
evidence of the Bible. In the absence of rain gauge and thermometric
records, <em>the most precise test of climate is given by the
vegetation; and fortunately the palm affords a very delicate test
of the past climate of Palestine and the eastern Mediterranean</em>....
The date palm has three limits of growth which are determined
by temperature; thus it does not reach full maturity or
produce ripe fruit of good quality below the mean annual temperature
of 69&deg;F. The isothermal of 69&deg; crosses southern Algeria
near Biskra; it touches the northern coasts of Cyrenaica near
Derna and passes Egypt near the mouth of the Nile, and then
bends northward along the coast lands of Palestine.</p>

<p>To the north of this line the date palm grows and produces
fruit, which only ripens occasionally, and its quality deteriorates
as the temperature falls below 69&deg;. Between the isotherms of
68&deg; and 64&deg;, limits which include northern Algeria, most of
Sicily, Malta, the southern parts of Greece and northern Syria,
the dates produced are so unripe that they are not edible. In the
next cooler zone, north of the isotherm of 62&deg;, which enters
Europe in southwestern Portugal, passes through Sardinia,
enters Italy near Naples, crosses northern Greece and Asia
Minor to the east of Smyrna, the date palm is grown only for
its foliage, since it does not fruit.</p>

<p>Hence at Benghazi, on the north African coast, the date palm
is fertile, but produces fruit of poor quality. In Sicily and at
Algiers the fruit ripens occasionally and at Rome and Nice the
palm is grown only as an ornamental tree.<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_92" title="pg 92"></a></p>

<p>The date palm therefore affords a test of variations in mean
annual temperature of three grades between 62&deg; and 69&deg;.</p>

<p>This test shows that the mean annual temperature of Palestine
has not altered since Old Testament times. The palm tree now
grows dates on the coast of Palestine and in the deep depression
around the Dead Sea, but it does not produce fruit on the highlands
of Judea. Its distribution in ancient times, as far as we
can judge from the Bible, was exactly the same. It grew at
"Jericho, the city of palm trees" (Deut. xxxiv: 3 and 2 Chron.
xxviii: 15), and at Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead
Sea (2 Chron. xx: 2; Sirach xxiv: 14); and though the palm
does not still live at Jericho&mdash;the last apparently died in 1838&mdash;its
disappearance must be due to neglect, for the only climatic
change that would explain it would be an increase in cold or
moisture. In olden times the date palm certainly grew on the
highlands of Palestine; but apparently it never produced fruit
there, for the Bible references to the palm are to its beauty and
erect growth: "The righteous shall flourish like the palm" (Ps.
xcii: 12); "They are upright as the palm tree" (Jer. x: 5);
"Thy stature is like to a palm tree" (Cant. vii: 7). It is used as
a symbol of victory (Rev. vii: 9), but never praised as a source
of food.</p>

<p>Dates are not once referred to in the text of the Bible, but
according to the marginal notes the word translated "honey" in
2 Chron. xxxi: 5 may mean dates....</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that the date palm had essentially the
same distribution in Palestine in Old Testament times as it has
now; and hence we may infer that the mean temperature was
then the same as now. If the climate had been moister and cooler,
the date could not have flourished at Jericho. If it had been
warmer, the palms would have grown freely at higher levels and
Jericho would not have held its distinction as <em>the</em> city of palm
trees.<sup><a href="#fn30" id="r30">[30]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the main Gregory's conclusions seem to be well
grounded, although even according to his data a change
<!--File: cc117.png Page 93-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_93" title="pg 93"></a>
of 2&deg; or 3&deg; in mean temperature would be perfectly
feasible. It will be noticed, however, that they apply to
temperature and not to rainfall. They merely prove that
two thousand years ago the mean temperature of Palestine
and the neighboring regions was not appreciably different
from what it is today. This, however, is in no sense
out of harmony with the hypothesis of climatic pulsations.
Students of glaciation believe that during the last
glacial epoch the mean temperature of the earth as a
whole was only 5&deg; or 6&deg;C. lower than at present. If the
difference between the climate of today and of the time of
Christ is a tenth as great as the difference between the
climate of today and that which prevailed at the culmination
of the last glacial epoch, the change in two thousand
years has been of large dimensions. Yet this would require
a rise of only half a degree Centigrade in the mean
temperature of Palestine. Manifestly, so slight a change
would scarcely be detectable in the vegetation.</p>

<p>The slightness of changes in mean temperature as compared
with changes in rainfall may be judged from a
comparison of wet and dry years in various regions. For
example, at Berlin between 1866 and 1905 the ten most
rainy years had an average precipitation of 670 mm. and
a mean temperature of 9.15&deg;C. On the other hand, the ten
years of least rainfall had an average of 483 mm. and a
mean temperature of 9.35&deg;. In other words, a difference
of 137 mm., or 39 per cent, in rainfall was accompanied
by a difference of only 0.2&deg;C. in temperature. Such contrasts
between the variability of mean rainfall and mean
temperature are observable not only when individual
years are selected, but when much longer periods are
taken. For instance, in the western Gulf region of the
United States the two inland stations of Vicksburg, Mississippi,
and Shreveport, Louisiana, and the two maritime
<!--File: cc118.png Page 94-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_94" title="pg 94"></a>
stations of New Orleans, Louisiana, and Galveston,
Texas, lie at the margins of an area about 400 miles long.
During the ten years from 1875 to 1884 their rainfall
averaged 59.4 inches,<sup><a href="#fn31" id="r31">[31]</a></sup> while during the ten years from
1890 to 1899 it averaged only 42.4 inches. Even in a
region so well watered as the Gulf States, such a change&mdash;40
per cent more in the first decade than in the second&mdash;is
important, and in drier regions it would have a great
effect on habitability. Yet in spite of the magnitude of
the change the mean temperature was not appreciably
different, the average for the four stations being 67.36&deg;F.
during the more rainy decade and 66.94&deg;F. during the
less rainy decade&mdash;a difference of only 0.42&deg;F. It is worth
noticing that in this case the wetter period was also the
warmer, whereas in Berlin it was the cooler. This is
probably because a large part of the moisture of the Gulf
States is brought by winds having a southerly component.
Similar relationships are apparent in other
places. We select Jerusalem because we have been discussing
Palestine. At the time of writing, the data available
in the <em>Quarterly Journal of the Palestine Exploration
Fund</em> cover the years from 1882-1899 and 1903-1909.
Among these twenty-five years the thirteen which had
most rain had an average of 34.1 inches and a temperature
of 62.04&deg;F. The twelve with least rain had 24.4 inches
and a temperature of 62.44&deg;. A difference of 40 per cent
in rainfall was accompanied by a difference of only
0.4&deg;F. in temperature.</p>

<p>The facts set forth in the preceding paragraphs seem
to show that extensive changes in precipitation and
storminess can take place without appreciable changes of
mean temperature. If such changed conditions can persist
<!--File: cc119.png Page 95-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_95" title="pg 95"></a>
for ten years, as in one of our examples, there is no
logical reason why they cannot persist for a hundred or
a thousand. The evidence of changes in climate during the
historic period seems to suggest changes in precipitation
much more than in temperature. Hence the strongest of
all the arguments against historic changes of climate
seems to be of relatively little weight, and the pulsatory
hypothesis seems to be in accord with all the known facts.</p>

<p>Before the true nature of climatic changes, whether
historic or geologic, can be rightly understood, another
point needs emphasis. When the pulsatory hypothesis
was first framed, it fell into the same error as the hypotheses
of uniformity and of progressive change&mdash;that
is, the assumption was made that the whole world is
either growing drier or moister with each pulsation. A
study of the ruins of Yucatan, in 1912, and of Guatemala,
in 1913, as is explained in <em>The Climatic Factor</em>, has led to
the conclusion that the climate of those regions has
changed in the opposite way from the changes which
appear to have taken place in the desert regions farther
south. These Maya ruins in Central America are in many
cases located in regions of such heavy rainfall, such dense
forests, and such malignant fevers that habitation is now
practically impossible. The land cannot be cultivated
except in especially favorable places. The people are
terribly weakened by disease and are among the lowest
in Central America. Only a hundred miles from the unhealthful
forests we find healthful areas, such as the
coasts of Yucatan and the plateau of Guatemala. Here
the vast majority of the population is gathered, the large
towns are located, and the only progressive people are
found. Nevertheless, in the past the region of the forests
was the home of by far the most progressive people who
are ever known to have lived in America previous to the
<!--File: cc120.png Page 96-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_96" title="pg 96"></a>
days of Columbus. They alone brought to high perfection
the art of sculpture; they were the only American people
who invented the art of writing. It seems scarcely credible
that such a people would have lived in the worst possible
habitat when far more favored regions were close
at hand. Therefore it seems as if the climate of eastern
Guatemala and Yucatan must have been relatively dry
at some past time. The Maya chronology and traditions
indicate that this was probably at the same time when
moister conditions apparently prevailed in the subarid
or desert portions of the United States and Asia. Fig. 3
shows that today at times of many sunspots there is
a similar opposition between a tendency toward storminess
and rain in subtropical regions and toward aridity
in low latitudes near the heat equator.</p>

<p>Thus our final conclusion is that during historic times
there have been pulsatory changes of climate. These
changes have been of the same type in regions having
similar kinds of climate, but of different and sometimes
opposite types in places having diverse climates. As to
the cause of the pulsations, they cannot have been due to
the precession of the equinoxes nor apparently to any
allied astronomical cause, for the time intervals are too
short and too irregular. They cannot have been due to
changes in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
for not even the strongest believers in the climatic
efficacy of that gas hold that its amount could fluctuate in
any such violent way as would be necessary to explain
the pulsations shown in the California curve of tree
growth. Volcanic activity seems more probable as at least
a partial cause, and it would be worth while to investigate
the matter more fully. Nevertheless, it can apparently
be only a minor cause. In the first place, the main effect
of a cloud of dust is to alter the temperature, but
<!--File: cc121.png Page 97-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_97" title="pg 97"></a>
Gregory's summary of the palm and the vine shows that
variations in temperature are apparently of very slight
importance during historic times. Again, ruins on the
bottoms of enclosed salt lakes, old beaches now under the
water, and signs of irrigation ditches where none are now
needed indicate a climate drier than the present. Volcanic
dust, however, cannot account for such a condition,
for at present the air seems to be practically free
from such dust for long periods. Thus we now experience
the greatest extreme which the volcanic hypothesis permits
in one direction, but there have been greater extremes
in the same direction. The thermal solar hypothesis
is likewise unable to explain the observed phenomena,
for neither it nor the volcanic hypothesis offers any explanation
of why the climate varies in one way in Mediterranean
climates and in an opposite way in regions
near the heat equator.</p>

This leaves the cyclonic hypothesis. It seems to fit the
facts, for variations in cyclonic storms cause some
regions to be moister and others drier than usual. At the
same time the variations in temperature are slight, and
are apparently different in different regions, some places
growing warm when others grow cool. In the next chapter
we shall study this matter more fully, for it can best
be appreciated by examining the course of events in a
specific century.

<h3>THE CLIMATIC STRESS OF THE FOURTEENTH
CENTURY</h3>


<p>In order to give concreteness to our picture of the
climatic pulsations of historic times let us take a
specific period and see how its changes of climate
were distributed over the globe and how they are related
to the little changes which now take place in the sunspot
cycle. We will take the fourteenth century of the Christian
era, especially the first half. This period is chosen
because it is the last and hence the best known of the
times when the climate of the earth seems to have taken
a considerable swing toward the conditions which now
prevail when the sun is most active, and which, if intensified,
would apparently lead to glaciation. It has already
been discussed in <em>World Power and Evolution</em>, but its
importance and the fact that new evidence is constantly
coming to light warrant a fuller discussion.</p>

<p>To begin with Europe; according to the careful account
of Pettersson<sup><a href="#fn32" id="r32">[32]</a></sup> the fourteenth century shows</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a record of extreme climatic variations. In the cold winters the
rivers Rhine, Danube, Thames, and Po were frozen for weeks
and months. On these cold winters there followed violent floods,
so that the rivers mentioned inundated their valleys. Such floods
are recorded in 55 summers in the 14th century. There is, of
<!--File: cc123.png Page 99-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_99" title="pg 99"></a>
course, nothing astonishing in the fact that the inundations of
the great rivers of Europe were more devastating 600 to 700
years ago than in our days, when the flow of the rivers has been
regulated by canals, locks, etc.; but still the inundations in the
13th and 14th centuries must have surpassed everything of that
kind which has occurred since then. In 1342 the waters of the
Rhine rose so high that they inundated the city of Mayence and
the Cathedral "usque ad cingulum hominis." The walls of
Cologne were flooded so that they could be passed by boats in
July. This occurred also in 1374 in the midst of the month of
February, which is of course an unusual season for disasters of
the kind. Again in other years the drought was so intense that
the same rivers, the Danube, Rhine, and others, nearly dried up,
and the Rhine could be forded at Cologne. This happened at least
twice in the same century. There is one exceptional summer of
such evil record that centuries afterwards it was spoken of as
"the old hot summer of 1357."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pettersson goes on to speak of two oceanic phenomena
on which the old chronicles lay greater stress than on
all others:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first [is] the great storm-floods on the coast of the North
Sea and the Baltic, which occurred so frequently that not less
than nineteen floods of a destructiveness unparalleled in later
times are recorded from the 14th century. The coastline of the
North Sea was completely altered by these floods. Thus on
January 16, 1300, half of the island Heligoland and many other
islands were engulfed by the sea. The same fate overtook the
island of Borkum, torn into several islands by the storm-flood of
January 16, which remoulded the Frisian Islands into their
present shape, when also Wendingstadt, on the island of Sylt,
and Thiryu parishes were engulfed. This flood is known under
the name of "the great man-drowning." The coasts of the Baltic
also were exposed to storm-floods of unparalleled violence. On
November 1, 1304, the island of Ruden was torn asunder from
Rugen by the force of the waves. Time does not allow me to
dwell upon individual disasters of this kind, but it will be well
<!--File: cc124.png Page 100-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_100" title="pg 100"></a>
to note that of the nineteen great floods on record eighteen
occurred in the cold season between the autumnal and vernal
equinoxes.</p>

<p>The second remarkable phenomenon mentioned by the chronicles
is the freezing of the entire Baltic, which occurred many
times during the cold winters of these centuries. On such occasions
it was possible to travel with carriages over the ice from
Sweden to Bornholm and from Denmark to the German coast
(Lubeck), and in some cases even from Gotland to the coast of
Estland.</p></blockquote>

<p>Norlind<sup><a href="#fn33" id="r33">[33]</a></sup> says that "the only authentic accounts" of
the complete freezing of the Baltic in the neighborhood
of the Kattegat are in the years 1296, 1306, 1323, and
1408. Of these 1296 is "much the most uncertain," while
1323 was the coldest year ever recorded, as appears from
the fact that horses and sleighs crossed regularly from
Sweden to Germany on the ice.</p>

<p>Not only central Europe and the shores of the North
Sea were marked by climatic stress during the fourteenth
century, but Scandinavia also suffered. As Pettersson
puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On examining the historic (data) from the last centuries of
the Middle Ages, Dr. Bull of Christiania has come to the conclusion
that the decay of the Norwegian kingdom was not so
much a consequence of the political conditions at that time, as
of the frequent failures of the harvest so that corn [wheat] for
bread had to be imported from L&uuml;beck, Rostock, Wismar and so
forth. The Hansa Union undertook the importation and obtained
political power by its economic influence. The Norwegian
land-owners were forced to lower their rents. The population
decreased and became impoverished. The revenue sank 60 to 70
per cent. Even the income from Church property decreased.
<!--File: cc125.png Page 101-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_101" title="pg 101"></a>
In 1367 corn was imported from L&uuml;beck to a value of one-half
million kroner. The trade balance inclined to the disadvantage
of Norway whose sole article of export at that time was
dried fish. (The production of fish increased enormously in the
Baltic regions off south Sweden because of the same changes
which were influencing the lands, but this did not benefit Norway.)
Dr. Bull draws a comparison with the conditions described
in the Sagas when Nordland [at the Arctic Circle] produced
enough corn to feed the inhabitants of the country. At the time
of Asbj&ouml;rn Selsbane the chieftains in Trondhen&auml;s [still farther
north in latitude 69&deg;] grew so much corn that they did not need
to go southward to buy corn unless three successive years of
dearth had occurred. The province of Trondheim exported wheat
to Iceland and so forth. Probably the turbulent political state
of Scandinavia at the end of the Middle Ages was in a great
measure due to unfavorable climatic conditions, which lowered
the standard of life, and not entirely to misgovernment and
political strife as has hitherto been taken for granted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During this same unfortunate first half of the fourteenth
century England also suffered from conditions
which, if sufficiently intensified, might be those of a glacial
period. According to Thorwald Rogers<sup><a href="#fn34" id="r34">[34]</a></sup> the severest
famine ever experienced in England was that of 1315-1316,
and the next worst was in 1321. In fact, from 1308
to 1322 great scarcity of food prevailed most of the time.
Other famines of less severity occurred in 1351 and 1369.
"The same cause was at work in all these cases," says
Rogers, "incessant rain, and cold, stormy summers. It
is said that the inclemency of the seasons affected the
cattle, and that numbers perished from disease and
want." After the bad harvest of 1315 the price of wheat,
which was already high, rose rapidly, and in May, 1316,
was about five times the average. For a year or more
thereafter it remained at three or four times the ordinary
<!--File: cc126.png Page 102-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_102" title="pg 102"></a>
level. The severity of the famine may be judged from the
fact that previous to the Great War the most notable
scarcity of wheat in modern England and the highest
relative price was in December, 1800. At that time wheat
cost nearly three times the usual amount, instead of five
as in 1316. During the famine of the early fourteenth century
"it is said that people were reduced to subsist upon
roots, upon horses and dogs, and stories are told of even
more terrible acts by reason of the extreme famine." The
number of deaths was so great that the price of labor
suffered a permanent rise of at least 10 per cent. There
simply were not people enough left among the peasants
to do the work demanded by the more prosperous class
who had not suffered so much.</p>

<p>After the famine came drought. The year 1325 appears
to have been peculiarly dry, and 1331, 1344, 1362, 1374,
and 1377 were also dry. In general these conditions do
little harm in England. They are of interest chiefly as
showing how excessive rain and drought are apt to
succeed one another.</p>

<p>These facts regarding northern and central Europe
during the fourteenth century are particularly significant
when compared with the conclusions which we have
drawn in <em>Earth and Sun</em> from the growth of trees in
Germany and from the distribution of storms. A careful
study of all the facts shows that we are dealing with two
distinct types of phenomena. In the first place, the climate
of central Europe seems to have been peculiarly continental
during the fourteenth century. The winters were
so cold that the rivers froze, and the summers were so
wet that there were floods every other year or oftener.
This seems to be merely an intensification of the conditions
which prevail at the present time during periods of
many sunspots, as indicated by the growth of trees at
<!--File: cc127.png Page 103-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_103" title="pg 103"></a>
Eberswalde in Germany and by the number of storms in
winter as compared with summer. The prevalence of
droughts, especially in the spring, is also not inconsistent
with the existence of floods at other seasons, for one of
the chief characteristics of a continental climate is that
the variations from one season to another are more
marked than in oceanic climates. Even the summer
droughts are typically continental, for when continental
conditions prevail, the difference between the same season
in different years is extreme, as is well illustrated in
Kansas. It must always be remembered that what causes
famine is not so much absolute dryness as a temporary
diminution of the rainfall.</p>

<p>The second type of phenomena is peculiarly oceanic in
character. It consists of two parts, both of which are
precisely what would be expected if a highly continental
climate prevailed over the land. In the first place, at certain
times the cold area of high pressure, which is the
predominating characteristic of a continent during the
winter, apparently spread out over the neighboring
oceans. Under such conditions an inland sea, such as the
Baltic, would be frozen, so that horses could cross the ice
even in the Far West. In the second place, because of the
unusually high pressure over the continent, the barometric
gradients apparently became intensified. Hence at
the margin of the continental high-pressure area the
winds were unusually strong and the storms of corresponding
severity. Some of these storms may have
passed entirely along oceanic tracks, while others invaded
the borders of the land, and gave rise to the floods
and to the wearing away of the coast described by
Pettersson.</p>

<p>Turning now to the east of Europe, Br&uuml;ckner's<sup><a href="#fn35" id="r35">[35]</a></sup> study
<!--File: cc128.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_104" title="pg 104"></a>
of the Caspian Sea shows that that region as well as
western Europe was subject to great climatic vicissitudes
in the first half of the fourteenth century. In 1306-1307
the Caspian Sea, after rising rapidly for several years,
stood thirty-seven feet above the present level and it
probably rose still higher during the succeeding decades.
At least it remained at a high level, for Hamdulla, the
Persian, tells us that in 1325 a place called Aboskun was
under water.<sup><a href="#fn36" id="r36">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p>Still further east the inland lake of Lop Nor also rose
at about this time. According to a Chinese account the
Dragon Town on the shore of Lop Nor was destroyed by
a flood. From Himley's translation it appears that the
level of the lake rose so as to overwhelm the city completely.
This would necessitate the expansion of the lake
to a point eighty miles east of Lulan, and fully fifty from
the present eastern end of the Kara Koshun marsh. The
water would have to rise nearly, or quite, to a strand
which is now clearly visible at a height of twelve feet
above the modern lake or marsh.</p>

<p>In India the fourteenth century was characterized by
what appears to have been the most disastrous drought
in all history. Apparently the decrease in rainfall here
was as striking as the increase in other parts of the
world. No statistics are available but we are told that in
the great famine which began in 1344 even the Mogul
emperor was unable to obtain the necessaries of life for
his household. No rain worth mentioning fell for years.
In some places the famine lasted three or four years, and
in some twelve, and entire cities were left without an inhabitant.
In a later famine, 1769-1770, which occurred in
Bengal shortly after the foundation of British rule in
<!--File: cc129.png Page 105-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_105" title="pg 105"></a>
India, but while the native officials were still in power,
a third of the population, or ten out of thirty millions,
perished. The famine in the first half of the fourteenth
century seems to have been far worse. These Indian
famines were apparently due to weak summer monsoons
caused presumably by the failure of central Asia to warm
up as much as usual. The heavier snowfall, and the
greater cloudiness of the summer there, which probably
accompanied increased storminess, may have been the
reason.</p>

<p>The New World as well as the Old appears to have
been in a state of climatic stress during the first half of
the fourteenth century. According to Pettersson, Greenland
furnishes an example of this. At first the inhabitants
of that northland were fairly prosperous and were able
to approach from Iceland without much hindrance from
the ice. Today the North Atlantic Ocean northeast of
Iceland is full of drift ice much of the time. The border
of the ice varies from season to season, but in general it
extends westward from Iceland not far from the Arctic
circle and then follows the coast of Greenland southward
to Cape Farewell at the southern tip and around to
the western side for fifty miles or more. Except under
exceptional circumstances a ship cannot approach the
coast until well northward on the comparatively ice-free
west coast. In the old Sagas, however, nothing is said of
ice in this region. The route from Iceland to Greenland
is carefully described. In the earliest times it went from
Iceland a trifle north of west so as to approach the coast
of Greenland after as short an ocean passage as possible.
Then it went down the coast in a region where approach
is now practically impossible because of the ice. At that
time this coast was icy close to the shore, but there is no
sign that navigation was rendered difficult as is now the
<!--File: cc130.png Page 106-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_106" title="pg 106"></a>
case. Today no navigator would think of keeping close
inland. The old route also went <em>north</em> of the island on
which Cape Farewell is located, although the narrow
channel between the island and the mainland is now so
blocked with ice that no modern vessel has ever penetrated
it. By the thirteenth century, however, there appears
to have been a change. In the Kungaspegel or
<em>Kings' Mirror</em>, written at that time, navigators are
warned not to make the east coast too soon on account
of ice, but no new route is recommended in the neighborhood
of Cape Farewell or elsewhere. Finally, however,
at the end of the fourteenth century, nearly 150 years
after the Kungaspegel, the old sailing route was abandoned,
and ships from Iceland sailed directly southwest
to avoid the ice. As Pettersson says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... At the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the
fourteenth century the European civilization in Greenland was
wiped out by an invasion of the aboriginal population. The colonists
in the Vesterbygd were driven from their homes and
probably migrated to America leaving behind their cattle in the
fields. So they were found by Ivar Bardsson, steward to the
Bishop of Gardar, in his official journey thither in 1342.</p>

<p>The Eskimo invasion must not be regarded as a common raid.
It was the transmigration of a people, and like other big movements
of this kind [was] impelled by altered conditions of
nature, in this case the alterations of climate caused by [or
which caused?] the advance of the ice. For their hunting and
fishing the Eskimos require an at least partially open arctic
sea. The seal, their principal prey, cannot live where the surface
of the sea is entirely frozen over. The cause of the favorable
conditions in the Viking-age was, according to my hypothesis,
that the ice then melted at a higher latitude in the arctic seas.</p>

<p>The Eskimos then lived further north in Greenland and
North America. When the climate deteriorated and the sea which
gave them their living was closed by ice the Eskimos had to find
<!--File: cc131.png Page 107-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_107" title="pg 107"></a>
a more suitable neighborhood. This they found in the land
colonized by the Norsemen whom they attacked and finally
annihilated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, far to the south in Yucatan the ancient Maya
civilization made its last flickering effort at about this
time. Not much is known of this but in earlier periods
the history of the Mayas seems to have agreed quite
closely with the fluctuations in climate.<sup><a href="#fn37" id="r37">[37]</a></sup> Among the
Mayas, as we have seen, relatively dry periods were the
times of greatest progress.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to Fig. 3 once more and compare the
climatic conditions of the fourteenth century with those
of periods of increasing rainfall. Southern England,
Ireland, and Scandinavia, where the crops were ruined
by extensive rain and storms in summer, are places
where storminess and rainfall now increase when sunspots
are numerous. Central Europe and the coasts of the
North Sea, where flood and drought alternated, are regions
which now have relatively less rain when sunspots
increase than when they diminish. However, as appears
from the trees measured by Douglass, the winters become
more continental and hence cooler, thus corresponding to
the cold winters of the fourteenth century when people
walked on the ice from Scandinavia to Denmark. When
such high pressure prevails in the winter, the total rainfall
is diminished, but nevertheless the storms are more
severe than usual, especially in the spring. In southeastern
Europe, the part of the area whence the Caspian
derives its water, appears to have less rainfall during
times of increasing sunspots than when sunspots are few,
but in an equally large area to the south, where the mountains
<!--File: cc132.png Page 108-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_108" title="pg 108"></a>
are higher and the run-off of the rain is more rapid,
the reverse is the case. This seems to mean that a slight
diminution in the water poured in by the Volga would
be more than compensated by the water derived from
Persia and from the Oxus and Jaxartes rivers, which in
the fourteenth century appear to have filled the Sea of
Aral and overflowed in a large stream to the Caspian.
Still farther east in central Asia, so far as the records go,
most of the country receives more rain when sunspots
are many than when they are few, which would agree
with what happened when the Dragon Town was inundated.
In India, on the contrary, there is a large area
where the rainfall diminishes at times of many sunspots,
thus agreeing with the terrible famine from which the
Moguls suffered so severely. In the western hemisphere,
Greenland, Arizona, and California are all parts of the
area where the rain increases with many sunspots, while
Yucatan seems to lie in an area of the opposite type. Thus
all the evidence seems to show that at times of climatic
stress, such as the fourteenth century, the conditions
are essentially the same as those which now prevail at
times of increasing sunspots.</p>

<p>As to the number of sunspots, there is little evidence
previous to about 1750. Yet that little is both interesting
and important. Although sunspots have been observed
with care in Europe only a little more than three centuries,
the Chinese have records which go back nearly to
the beginning of the Christian era. Of course the records
are far from perfect, for the work was done by individuals
and not by any great organization which continued
the same methods from generation to generation.
The mere fact that a good observer happened to use his
smoked glass to advantage may cause a particular period
to appear to have an unusual number of spots. On the
<!--File: cc133.png Page 109-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_109" title="pg 109"></a>
other hand, the fact that such an observer finds spots
at some times and not at others tends to give a valuable
check on his results, as does the comparison of one
observer's work with that of another. Hence, in spite of
many and obvious defects, most students of the problem
agree that the Chinese record possesses much value, and
that for a thousand years or more it gives a fairly true
idea of the general aspect of the sun. In the Chinese
records the years with many spots fall in groups, as
would be expected, and are sometimes separated by long
intervals. Certain centuries appear to have been marked
by unusual spottedness. The most conspicuous of these
is the fourteenth, when the years 1370 to 1385 were particularly
noteworthy, for spots large enough to be visible
to the naked eye covered the sun much of the time. Hence
Wolf,<sup><a href="#fn38" id="r38">[38]</a></sup> who has made an exhaustive study of the matter,
concludes that there was an absolute maximum of spots
about 1372. While this date is avowedly open to question,
the great abundance of sunspots at that time makes it
probable that it cannot be far wrong. If this is so, it
seems that the great climatic disturbances of which we
have seen evidence in the fourteenth century occurred at
a time when sunspots were increasing, or at least when
solar activity was under some profoundly disturbing influence.
Thus the evidence seems to show not merely that
the climate of historic times has been subject to important
pulsations, but that those pulsations were magnifications
of the little climatic changes which now take
place in sunspot cycles. The past and the present are
apparently a unit except as to the intensity of the
changes.</p>

<h3>GLACIATION ACCORDING TO THE SOLAR-CYCLONIC
HYPOTHESIS<sup><a href="#fn39" id="r39">[39]</a></sup></h3>


<p>The remarkable phenomena of glacial periods
afford perhaps the best available test to which
any climatic hypothesis can be subjected. In this
chapter and the two that follow, we shall apply this test.
Since much more is known about the recent Great Ice
Age, or Pleistocene glaciation, than about the more
ancient glaciations, the problems of the Pleistocene will
receive especial attention. In the present chapter the
oncoming of glaciation and the subsequent disappearance
of the ice will be outlined in the light of what would
be expected according to the solar-cyclonic hypothesis.
Then in the next chapter several problems of especial
climatic significance will be considered, such as the localization
of ice sheets, the succession of severe glacial and
mild inter-glacial epochs, the sudden commencement of
glaciation and the peculiar variations in the height of the
snow line. Other topics to be considered are the occurrence
of pluvial or rainy climates in non-glaciated regions,
and glaciation near sea level in subtropical
latitudes during the Permian and Proterozoic. Then in
Chapter IX we shall consider the development and distribution
of the remarkable deposits of wind-blown material
known as loess.</p>

<p>Facts not considered at the time of framing an hypothesis
<!--File: cc135.png Page 111-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_111" title="pg 111"></a>
are especially significant in testing it. In this particular
case, the cyclonic hypothesis was framed to explain
the historic changes of climate revealed by a study of
ruins, tree rings, and the terraces of streams and lakes,
without special thought of glaciation or other geologic
changes. Indeed, the hypothesis had reached nearly its
present form before much attention was given to geological
phases of the problem. Nevertheless, it appears
to meet even this severe test.</p>

<p>According to the solar-cyclonic hypothesis, the Pleistocene
glacial period was inaugurated at a time when certain
terrestrial conditions tended to make the earth
especially favorable for glaciation. How these conditions
arose will be considered later. Here it is enough to state
what they were. Chief among them was the fact that the
continents stood unusually high and were unusually
large. This, however, was not the primary cause of glaciation,
for many of the areas which were soon to be
glaciated were little above sea level. For example, it
seems clear that New England stood less than a thousand
feet higher than now. Indeed, Salisbury<sup><a href="#fn40" id="r40">[40]</a></sup> estimates that
eastern North America in general stood not more than
a few hundred feet higher than now, and W. B. Wright<sup><a href="#fn41" id="r41">[41]</a></sup>
reaches the same conclusion in respect to the British
Isles. Nevertheless, widespread lands, even if they are
not all high, lead to climatic conditions which favor
glaciation. For example, enlarged continents cause low
temperature in high latitudes because they interfere with
the ocean currents that carry heat polewards. Such continents
also cause relatively cold winters, for lands cool
much sooner than does the ocean. Another result is a
<!--File: cc136.png Page 112-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_112" title="pg 112"></a>
diminution of water vapor, not only because cold air
cannot hold much vapor, but also because the oceanic
area from which evaporation takes place is reduced by
the emergence of the continents. Again, when the continents
are extensive the amount of carbonic acid gas in
the atmosphere probably decreases, for the augmented
erosion due to uplift exposes much igneous rock to the
air, and weathering consumes the atmospheric carbon
dioxide. When the supply of water vapor and of atmospheric
carbon dioxide is small, an extreme type of climate
usually prevails. The combined result of all these conditions
is that continental emergence causes the climate to
be somewhat cool and to be marked by relatively great
contrasts from season to season and from latitude to
latitude.</p>

<p>When the terrestrial conditions thus permitted glaciation,
unusual solar activity is supposed to have greatly
increased the number and severity of storms and to have
altered their location, just as now happens at times of
many sunspots. If such a change in storminess had occurred
when terrestrial conditions were unfavorable for
glaciation, as, for example, when the lands were low and
there were widespread epicontinental seas in middle and
high latitudes, glaciation might not have resulted. In the
Pleistocene, however, terrestrial conditions permitted
glaciation, and therefore the supposed increase in storminess
caused great ice sheets.</p>

<p>The conditions which prevail at times of increased
storminess have been discussed in detail in <em>Earth and
Sun</em>. Those which apparently brought on glaciation seem
to have acted as follows: In the first place the storminess
lowered the temperature of the earth's surface in several
ways. The most important of these was the rapid upward
convection in the centers of cyclonic storms whereby
<!--File: cc137.png Page 113-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_113" title="pg 113"></a>
abundant heat was carried to high levels where most of it
was radiated away into space. The marked increase in
the number of tropical cyclones which accompanies increased
solar activity was probably important in this
respect. Such cyclones carry vast quantities of heat and
moisture out of the tropics. The moisture, to be sure,
liberates heat upon condensing, but as condensation
occurs above the earth's surface, much of the heat
escapes into space. Another reason for low temperature
was that under the influence of the supposedly numerous
storms of Pleistocene times evaporation over the oceans
must have increased. This is largely because the velocity
of the winds is relatively great when storms are strong
and such winds are powerful agents of evaporation. But
evaporation requires heat, and hence the strong winds
lower the temperature.<sup><a href="#fn42" id="r42">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>The second great condition which enabled increased
storminess to bring on glaciation was the location of the
storm tracks. Kullmer's maps, as illustrated in Fig. 2,
suggest that a great increase in solar activity, such as is
postulated in the Pleistocene, might shift the main storm
track poleward even more than it is shifted by the milder
solar changes during the twelve-year sunspot cycle. If
this is so, the main track would tend to cross North
America through the middle of Canada instead of near
the southern border. Thus there would be an increase in
precipitation in about the latitude of the Keewatin and
Labradorean centers of glaciation. From what is known
of storm tracks in Europe, the main increase in the intensity
of storms would probably center in Scandinavia.
Fig. 3 in Chapter V bears this out. That figure, it will be
recalled, shows what happens to precipitation when solar
<!--File: cc138.png Page 114-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_114" title="pg 114"></a>
activity is increasing. A high rate of precipitation is
especially marked in the boreal storm track, that is, in
the northern United States, southern Canada, and northwestern
Europe.</p>

<p>Another important condition in bringing on glaciation
would be the fact that when storms are numerous the
total precipitation appears to increase in spite of the
slightly lower temperature. This is largely because of the
greater evaporation. The excessive evaporation arises
partly from the rapidity of the winds, as already stated,
and partly from the fact that in areas where the air is
clear the sun would presumably be able to act more effectively
than now. It would do so because at times of abundant
sunspots the sun in our own day has a higher solar
constant than at times of milder activity. Our whole
hypothesis is based on the supposition that what now
happens at times of many sunspots was intensified in
glacial periods.</p>

<p>A fourth condition which would cause glaciation to
result from great solar activity would be the fact that
the portion of the yearly precipitation falling as snow
would increase, while the proportion of rain would diminish
in the main storm track. This would arise partly because
the storms would be located farther north than
now, and partly because of the diminution in temperature
due to the increased convection. The snow in itself would
still further lower the temperature, for snow is an excellent
reflector of sunlight. The increased cloudiness which
would accompany the more abundant storms would also
cause an unusually great reflection of the sunlight and
still further lower the temperature. Thus at times of
many sunspots a strong tendency toward the accumulation
of snow would arise from the rapid convection and
consequent low temperature, from the northern location
<!--File: cc139.png Page 115-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_115" title="pg 115"></a>
of storms, from the increased evaporation and precipitation,
from the larger percentage of snowy rather than
rainy precipitation, and from the great loss of heat due
to reflection from clouds and snow.</p>

<p>If events at the beginning of the last glacial period
took place in accordance with the cyclonic hypothesis, as
outlined above, one of the inevitable results would be the
production of snowfields. The places where snow would
accumulate in special quantities would be central Canada,
the Labrador plateau, and Scandinavia, as well as certain
mountain regions. As soon as a snowfield became
somewhat extensive, it would begin to produce striking
climatic alterations in addition to those to which it owed
its origin.<sup><a href="#fn43" id="r43">[43]</a></sup> For example, within a snowfield the summers
remain relatively cold. Hence such a field is likely to be
an area of high pressure at all seasons. The fact that the
snowfield is always a place of relatively high pressure
results in outblowing surface winds except when these
are temporarily overcome by the passage of strong cyclonic
storms. The storms, however, tend to be concentrated
near the margins of the ice throughout the year
instead of following different paths in each of the four
seasons. This is partly because cyclonic lows always
avoid places of high pressure and are thus pushed out
of the areas where permanent snow has accumulated.
On the other hand, at times of many sunspots, as Kullmer
has shown, the main storm track tends to be drawn
<!--File: cc140.png Page 116-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_116" title="pg 116"></a>
poleward, perhaps by electrical conditions. Hence when
a snowfield is present in the north, the lows, instead of
migrating much farther north in summer than in winter,
as they now do, would merely crowd on to the snowfield
a little farther in summer than in winter. Thus the heavy
precipitation which is usual in humid climates near the
centers of lows would take place near the advancing
margin of the snowfield and cause the field to expand
still farther southward.</p>

<p>The tendency toward the accumulation of snow on the
margins of the snowfields would be intensified not only
by the actual storms themselves, but by other conditions.
For example, the coldness of the snow would tend to
cause prompt condensation of the moisture brought by
the winds that blow toward the storm centers from low
latitudes. Again, in spite of the general dryness of the
air over a snowfield, the lower air contains some moisture
due to evaporation from the snow by day during the
clear sunny weather of anti-cyclones or highs. Where this
is sufficient, the cold surface of the snowfields tends to
produce a frozen fog whenever the snowfield is cooled
by radiation, as happens at night and during the passage
of highs. Such a frozen fog is an effective reflector of
solar radiation. Moreover, because ice has only half the
specific heat of water, and is much more transparent to
heat, such a "radiation fog" composed of ice crystals is
a much less effective retainer of heat than clouds or fog
made of unfrozen water particles. Shallow fogs of this
type are described by several polar expeditions. They
clearly retard the melting of the snow and thus help the
icefield to grow.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, so long as storminess remained
great, the Pleistocene snowfields, according to the solar
hypothesis, must have deepened and expanded. In due
<!--File: cc141.png Page 117-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_117" title="pg 117"></a>
time some of the snow was converted into glacial ice.
When that occurred, the growth of the snowfield as well
as of the ice cap must have been accelerated by glacial
movement. Under such circumstances, as the ice crowded
southward toward the source of the moisture by which it
grew, the area of high pressure produced by its low
temperature would expand. This would force the storm
track southward in spite of the contrary tendency due to
the sun. When the ice sheet had become very extensive,
the track would be crowded relatively near to the northern
margin of the trade-wind belt. Indeed, the Pleistocene
ice sheets, at the time of their maximum extension,
reached almost as far south as the latitude now marking
the northern limit of the trade-wind belt in summer.
As the storm track with its frequent low pressure and the
subtropical belt with its high pressure were forced nearer
and nearer together, the barometric gradient between
the two presumably became greater, winds became
stronger, and the storms more intense.</p>

<p>This zonal crowding would be of special importance in
summer, at which time it would also be most pronounced.
In the first place, the storms would be crowded far upon
the ice cap which would then be protected from the sun
by a cover of fog and cloud more fully than at any other
season. Furthermore, the close approach of the trade-wind
belt to the storm belt would result in a great increase
in the amount of moisture drawn from the belt of
evaporation which the trade winds dominate. In the
trade-wind belt, clear skies and high temperature make
evaporation especially rapid. Indeed, in spite of the vast
deserts it is probable that more than three-fourths of the
total evaporation now taking place on the earth occurs
in the belt of trades, an area which includes about one-half
of the earth's surface.</p>
<!--File: cc142.png Page 118-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_118" title="pg 118"></a>

<p>The agency which could produce this increased drawing
northward of moisture from the trade-wind belt
would be the winds blowing into the lows. According to
the cyclonic hypothesis, many of these lows would be so
strong that they would temporarily break down the subtropical
belt of high pressure which now usually prevails
between the trades and the zone of westerly winds. This
belt is even now often broken by tropical cyclones. If the
storms of more northerly regions temporarily destroyed
the subtropical high-pressure belt, even though they still
remained on its northern side, they would divert part of
the trade winds. Hence the air which now is carried
obliquely equatorward by those winds would be carried
spirally northward into the cyclonic lows. Precipitation
in the storm track on the margin of the relatively cold ice
sheet would thus be much increased, for most winds from
low latitudes carry abundant moisture. Such a diversion
of moisture from low latitudes probably explains the
deficiency of precipitation along the heat equator at
times of solar activity, as shown in Fig. 3. Taken as a
whole, the summer conditions, according to the cyclonic
hypothesis, would be such that increased evaporation in
low latitudes would co&ouml;perate with increased storminess,
cloudiness, and fog in higher latitudes to preserve and
increase the accumulation of ice upon the borders of the
ice sheet. The greater the storminess, the more this would
be true and the more the ice sheet would be able to hold
its own against melting in summer. Such a combination
of precipitation and of protection from the sun is especially
important if an ice sheet is to grow.</p>

<p>The meteorologist needs no geologic evidence that the
storm track was shoved equatorward by the growth of
the ice sheet, for he observes a similar shifting whenever
a winter's snow cap occupies part of the normal storm
<!--File: cc143.png Page 119-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_119" title="pg 119"></a>
tract. The geologist, however, may welcome geologic
evidence that such an extreme shift of the storm track
actually occurred during the Pleistocene. Harmer, in
1901, first pointed out the evidence which was repeated
with approval by Wright of the Ireland Geological Survey
in 1914.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="r44">[44]</a></sup> According to these authorities, numerous
boulders of a distinctive chalk were deposited by Pleistocene
icebergs along the coast of Ireland. Their distribution
shows that at the time of maximum glaciation the
strong winds along the south coast of Ireland were from
the northeast while today they are from the southwest.
Such a reversal could apparently be produced only by a
southward shift of the center of the main storm track
from its present position in northern Ireland, Scotland,
and Norway to a position across northern France, central
Germany, and middle Russia. This would mean that while
now the centers of the lows commonly move northeastward
a short distance north of southern Ireland, they
formerly moved eastward a short distance south of Ireland.
It will be recalled that in the northern hemisphere
the winds spiral into a low counter-clockwise and that
they are strongest near the center. When the centers pass
not far north of a given point, the strong winds therefore
blow from the west or southwest, while when the centers
pass just south of that point, the strong winds come from
the east or northeast.</p>

<p>In addition to the consequences of the crowding of the
storm track toward the trade-wind belt, several other
conditions presumably operated to favor the growth of
the ice sheet. For example, the lowering of the sea level
by the removal of water to form the snowfields and
glaciers interfered with warm currents. It also increased
the rate of erosion, for it was equivalent to an uplift of
<!--File: cc144.png Page 120-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_120" title="pg 120"></a>
all the land. One consequence of erosion and weathering
was presumably a diminution of the carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere, for although the ice covered perhaps a
tenth of the lands and interfered with carbonation to that
extent, the removal of large quantities of soil by accelerated
erosion on the other nine-tenths perhaps more than
counterbalanced the protective effect of the ice. At the
same time, the general lowering of the temperature of the
ocean as well as the lands increased the ocean's capacity
for carbon dioxide and thus facilitated absorption. At a
temperature of 50&deg;F. water absorbs 32 per cent more
carbon dioxide than at 68&deg;. The high waves produced by
the severe storms must have had a similar effect on a
small scale. Thus the percentage of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere was presumably diminished. Of less significance
than these changes in the lands and the air, but
perhaps not negligible, was the increased salinity of the
ocean which accompanied the removal of water to form
snow, and the increase of the dissolved mineral load of
the rejuvenated streams. Increased salinity slows up the
deep-sea circulation, as we shall see in a later chapter.
This increases the contrasts from zone to zone.</p>

<p>At times of great solar activity the agencies mentioned
above would apparently co&ouml;perate to cause an advance of
ice sheets into lower latitudes. The degree of solar activity
would have much to do with the final extent of the ice
sheets. Nevertheless, certain terrestrial conditions would
tend to set limits beyond which the ice would not greatly
advance unless the storminess were extraordinarily
severe. The most obvious of these conditions is the location
of oceans and of deserts or semi-arid regions. The
southwestward advance of the European ice sheet and
the southeastward advance of the Labradorean sheet in
America were stopped by the Atlantic. The semi-aridity
<!--File: cc145.png Page 121-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_121" title="pg 121"></a>
of the Great Plains, produced by their position in the lee
of the Rocky Mountains, stopped the advance of the
Keewatin ice sheet toward the southwest. The advance of
the European ice sheet southeast seems to have been
stopped for similar reasons. The cessation of the advance
would be brought about in such an area not alone by the
light precipitation and abundant sunshine, but by the
dryness of the air, and also by the power of dust to absorb
the sun's heat. Much dust would presumably be
drawn in from the dry regions by passing cyclonic storms
and would be scattered over the ice.</p>

<p>The advance of the ice is also slowed up by a rugged
topography, as among the Appalachians in northern
Pennsylvania. Such a topography besides opposing a
physical obstruction to the movement of the ice provides
bare south-facing slopes which the sun warms effectively.
Such warm slopes are unfavorable to glacial advance.
The rugged topography was perhaps quite as effective as
the altitude of the Appalachians in causing the conspicuous
northward dent in the glacial margin in Pennsylvania.
Where glaciers lie in mountain valleys the advance
beyond a certain point is often interfered with by the
deployment of the ice at the mouths of gorges. Evaporation
and melting are more rapid where a glacier is broad
and thin than where it is narrow and thick, as in a gorge.
Again, where the topography or the location of oceans or
dry areas causes the glacial lobes to be long and narrow,
the elongation of the lobe is apparently checked in several
ways. Toward the end of the lobe, melting and
evaporation increase rapidly because the planetary
westerly winds are more likely to overcome the glacial
winds and sweep across a long, narrow lobe than across
a broad one. As they cross the lobe, they accelerate
evaporation, and probably lessen cloudiness, with a consequent
<!--File: cc146.png Page 122-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_122" title="pg 122"></a>
augmentation of melting. Moreover, although
lows rarely cross a broad ice sheet, they do cross a
narrow lobe. For example, Nansen records that strong
lows occasionally cross the narrow southern part of the
Greenland ice sheet. The longer the lobe, the more likely
it is that lows will cross it, instead of following its margin.
Lows which cross a lobe do not yield so much snow
to the tip as do those which follow the margin. Hence
elongation is retarded and finally stopped even without
a change in the earth's general climate.</p>

<p>Because of these various reasons the advances of the
ice during the several epochs of a glacial period might
be approximately equal, even if the durations of the
periods of storminess and low temperature were different.
Indeed, they might be sub-equal, even if the periods
differed in intensity as well as length. Differences in the
periods would apparently be manifested less in the extent
of the ice than in the depth of glacial erosion and in
the thickness of the terminal moraines, outwash plains,
and other glacial or glacio-fluvial formations.</p>

<p>Having completed the consideration of the conditions
leading to the advance of the ice, let us now consider the
condition of North America at the time of maximum
glaciation.<sup><a href="#fn45" id="r45">[45]</a></sup>
Over an area of nearly four million square
miles, occupying practically all the northern half of the
continent and part of the southern half, as appears in
Fig. 6, the surface was a monotonous and almost level
plain of ice covered with snow. When viewed from a
high altitude, all parts except the margins must have
presented a uniformly white and sparkling appearance.
Along the margins, however, except to the north, the
<!--File: cc145.png Page 123-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_123" title="pg 123"></a>
whiteness was irregular, for the view must have included
not only fresh snow, but moving clouds and dirty snow
or ice. Along the borders where melting was in progress
there was presumably more or less spottedness due to
morainal material or glacial d&eacute;bris brought to the surface
by ice shearage and wastage. Along the dry southwestern
border it is also possible that there were numerous
dark spots due to dust blown onto the ice by the
wind.</p>

<p class="center"> <em>Fig. 6. Distribution of Pleistocene ice sheets.<br />
(After Schuchert.</em>)</p>


<p>The great white sheet with its ragged border was
roughly circular in form, with its center in central
Canada. Yet there were many departures from a perfectly
circular form. Some were due to the oceans, for,
except in northern Alaska, the ice extended into the
ocean all the way from New Jersey around by the north
to Washington. On the south, topographic conditions
made the margin depart from a simple arc. From New
Jersey to Ohio it swung northward. In the Mississippi
Valley it reached far south; indeed most of the broad
wedge between the Ohio and the Missouri rivers was
occupied by ice. From latitude 37&deg; near the junction of
the Missouri and the Mississippi, however, the ice margin
extended almost due north along the Missouri to central
North Dakota. It then stretched westward to the Rockies.
Farther west lowland glaciation was abundant as far
south as western Washington. In the Rockies, the Cascades,
and the Sierra Nevadas glaciation was common as
far south as Colorado and southern California, respectively,
and snowfields were doubtless extensive enough to
make these ranges ribbons of white. Between these lofty
ranges lay a great unglaciated region, but even in the
Great Basin itself, in spite of its present aridity, certain
ranges carried glaciers, while great lakes expanded
widely.</p>
<!--File: cc149.png Page 125-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_125" title="pg 125"></a>

<p>In this vast field of snow the glacial ice slowly crept
outward, possibly at an average speed of half a foot a
day, but varying from almost nothing in winter at the
north, to several feet a day in summer at the south.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="r46">[46]</a></sup> The
force which caused the movement was the presence of
the ice piled up not far from the margins. Almost certainly,
however, there was no great dome from the
center in Canada outward, as some early writers assumed.
Such a dome would require that the ice be many
thousands of feet thick near its center. This is impossible
because of the fact that ice is more voluminous than
water (about 9 per cent near the freezing point). Hence
when subjected to sufficient pressure it changes to the
liquid form. As friction and internal heat tend to keep
the bottom of a glacier warm, even in cold regions, the
probabilities are that only under very special conditions
was a continental ice sheet much thicker than about 2500
feet. In Antarctica, where the temperature is much lower
than was probably attained in the United States, the ice
sheet is nearly level, several expeditions having traveled
hundreds of miles with practically no change in altitude.
In Shackleton's trip almost to the South Pole, he encountered
a general rise of 3000 feet in 1200 miles. Mountains,
however, projected through the ice even near the
pole and the geologists conclude that the ice is not very
thick even at the world's coldest point, the South Pole.</p>

<p>Along the margin of the ice there were two sorts of
movement, much more rapid than the slow creep of the
ice. One was produced by the outward drift of snow
carried by the outblowing dry winds and the other and
more important was due to the passage of cyclonic
storms. Along the border of the ice sheet, except at the
<!--File: cc150.png Page 126-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_126" title="pg 126"></a>
north, storm presumably closely followed storm. Their
movement, we judge, was relatively slow until near the
southern end of the Mississippi lobe, but when this point
was passed they moved much more rapidly, for then they
could go toward instead of away from the far northern
path which the sun prescribes when solar activity is
great. The storms brought much snow to the icefield,
perhaps sometimes in favored places as much as the hundred
feet a year which is recorded for some winters in the
Sierras at present. Even the unglaciated intermontane
Great Basin presumably received considerable precipitation,
perhaps twice as much as its present scanty
supply. The rainfall was enough to support many lakes,
one of which was ten times as large as Great Salt Lake;
and grass was doubtless abundant upon many slopes
which are now dry and barren. The relatively heavy
precipitation in the Great Basin was probably due primarily
to the increased number of storms, but may also
have been much influenced by their slow eastward movement.
The lows presumably moved slowly in that general
region not only because they were retarded and turned
from their normal path by the cold ice to the east, but
because during the summer the area between the Sierra
snowfields on the west and the Rocky Mountain and Mississippi
Valley snowfields on the east was relatively
warm. Hence it was normally a place of low pressure
and therefore of inblowing winds. Slow-moving lows are
much more effective than fast-moving ones in drawing
moisture northwestward from the Gulf of Mexico, for
they give the moisture more time to move spirally first
northeast, under the influence of the normal southwesterly
winds, then northwest and finally southwest as
it approaches the storm center. In the case of the present
lows, before much moisture-laden air can describe such
<!--File: cc151.png Page 127-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_127" title="pg 127"></a>
a circuit, first eastward and then westward, the storm
center has nearly always moved eastward across the
Rockies and even across the Great Plains. A result of this
is the regular decrease in precipitation northward, northwestward,
and westward from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Along the part of the glacial margins where for more
than 3000 miles the North American ice entered the
Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, myriads of great blocks
broke off and floated away as stately icebergs, to scatter
boulders far over the ocean floor and to melt in warmer
climes. Where the margin lay upon the lands numerous
streams issued from beneath the ice, milk-white with
rock flour, and built up great outwash plains and valley
trains of gravel and sand. Here and there, just beyond
the ice, marginal lakes of strange shapes occupied valleys
which had been dammed by the advancing ice. In many
of them the water level rose until it reached some low
point in the divide and then overflowed, forming rapids
and waterfalls. Indeed, many of the waterfalls of the
eastern United States and Canada were formed in just
this way and not a few streams now occupy courses
through ridges instead of parallel to them, as in pre-glacial
times.</p>

<p>In the zone to the south of the continental ice sheet,
the plant and animal life of boreal, cool temperate, and
warm temperate regions commingled curiously. Heather
and Arctic willow crowded out elm and oak; musk ox,
hairy mammoth, and marmot contested with deer, chipmunk,
and skunk for a chance to live. Near the ice on
slopes exposed to the cold glacial gales, the immigrant
boreal species were dominant, but not far away in more
protected areas the species that had formerly lived there
held their own. In Europe during the last two advances
of the great ice sheet the caveman also struggled with
<!--File: cc152.png Page 128-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_128" title="pg 128"></a>
fierce animals and a fiercer climate to maintain life in an
area whose habitability had long been decreasing.</p>

<p>The next step in our history of glaciation is to outline
the disappearance of the ice sheets. When a decrease in
solar activity produced a corresponding decrease in
storminess, several influences presumably combined to
cause the disappearance of the ice. Most of their results
are the reverse of those which brought on glaciation. A
few special aspects, however, some of which have been
discussed in <em>Earth and Sun</em>, ought to be brought to mind.
A diminution in storminess lessens upward convection,
wind velocity, and evaporation, and these changes, if they
occurred, must have united to raise the temperature of
the lower air by reducing the escape of heat. Again a
decrease in the number and intensity of tropical cyclones
presumably lessened the amount of moisture carried into
mid-latitudes, and thus diminished the precipitation. The
diminution of snowfall on the ice sheets when storminess
diminished was probably highly important. The amount
of precipitation on the sheets was presumably lessened
still further by changes in the storminess of middle
latitudes. When storminess diminishes, the lows follow a
less definite path, as Kullmer's maps show, and on the
average a more southerly path. Thus, instead of all the
lows contributing snow to the ice sheet, a large fraction
of the relatively few remaining lows would bring rain to
areas south of the ice sheet. As storminess decreased, the
trades and westerlies probably became steadier, and thus
carried to high latitudes more warm water than when
often interrupted by storms. Steadier southwesterly
winds must have produced a greater movement of atmospheric
as well as oceanic heat to high latitudes. The
warming due to these two causes was probably the chief
reason for the disappearance of the European ice sheet
<!--File: cc153.png Page 129-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_129" title="pg 129"></a>
and of those on the Pacific coast of North America. The
two greater American ice sheets, however, and the
glaciers elsewhere in the lee of high mountain ranges,
probably disappeared chiefly because of lessened precipitation.
If there were no cyclonic storms to draw moisture
northward from the Gulf of Mexico, most of North
America east of the Rocky Mountain barrier would be
arid. Therefore a diminution of storminess would be
particularly effective in causing the disappearance of ice
sheets in these regions.</p>

<p>That evaporation was an especially important factor
in causing the ice from the Keewatin center to disappear,
is suggested by the relatively small amount of water-sorted
material in its drift. In South Dakota, for example,
less than 10 per cent of the drift is stratified.<sup><a href="#fn47" id="r47">[47]</a></sup> On
the other hand, Salisbury estimates that perhaps a third
of the Labradorean drift in eastern Wisconsin is crudely
stratified, about half of that in New Jersey, and more
than half of the drift in western Europe.</p>

<p>When the sun's activity began to diminish, all these
conditions, as well as several others, would co&ouml;perate to
cause the ice sheets to disappear. Step by step with their
disappearance, the amelioration of the climate would
progress so long as the period of solar inactivity continued
and storms were rare. If the inactivity continued
long enough, it would result in a fairly mild climate in
high latitudes, though so long as the continents were
emergent this mildness would not be of the extreme type.
The inauguration of another cycle of increased disturbance
of the sun, with a marked increase in storminess,
would inaugurate another glacial epoch. Thus a succession
of glacial and inter-glacial epochs might continue so
long as the sun was repeatedly disturbed.</p>

<h3>SOME PROBLEMS OF GLACIAL PERIODS</h3>


<p>Having outlined in general terms the coming of
the ice sheets and their disappearance, we are
now ready to discuss certain problems of compelling
climatic interest. The discussion will be grouped
under five heads: (I) the localization of glaciation; (II)
the sudden coming of glaciation; (III) peculiar variations
in the height of the snow line and of glaciation;
(IV) lakes and other evidences of humidity in unglaciated
regions during the glacial epochs; (V) glaciation
at sea level and in low latitudes in the Permian and
Proterozoic eras. The discussion of perhaps the most
difficult of all climatic problems of glaciation, that of the
succession of cold glacial and mild inter-glacial epochs,
has been postponed to the next to the final chapter of this
book. It cannot be properly considered until we take up
the history of solar disturbances.</p>

<p>I. The first problem, the localization of the ice sheets,
arises from the fact that in both the Pleistocene and the
Permian periods glaciation was remarkably limited. In
neither period were all parts of high latitudes glaciated;
yet in both cases glaciation occurred in large regions in
lower latitudes. Many explanations of this localization
have been offered, but most are entirely inadequate. Even
hypotheses with something of proven worth, such as
those of variations in volcanic dust and in atmospheric
<!--File: cc155.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_131" title="pg 131"></a>
carbon dioxide, fail to account for localization. The
cyclonic form of the solar hypothesis, however, seems to
afford a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>The distribution of the ice in the last glacial period is
well known, and is shown in Fig. 6. Four-fifths of the
ice-covered area, which was eight million square miles,
more or less, was near the borders of the North Atlantic
in eastern North America and northwestern Europe.
The ice spread out from two great centers in North
America, the Labradorean east of Hudson Bay, and the
Keewatin west of the bay. There were also many glaciers
in the western mountains, especially in Canada, while
subordinate centers occurred in Newfoundland, the Adirondacks,
and the White Mountains. The main ice sheet
at its maximum extension reached as far south as latitude
39&deg; in Kansas and Kentucky, and 37&deg; in Illinois.
Huge boulders were transferred more than one thousand
miles from their source in Canada. The northward extension
was somewhat less. Indeed, the northern margin
of the continent was apparently relatively little glaciated
and much of Alaska unglaciated. Why should northern
Kentucky be glaciated when northern Alaska was not?</p>

<p>In Europe the chief center from which the continental
glacier moved was the Scandinavian highlands. It pushed
across the depression now occupied by the Baltic to
southern Russia and across the North Sea depression
to England and Belgium. The Alps formed a center of
considerable importance, and there were minor centers
in Scotland, Ireland, the Pyrenees, Apennines, Caucasus,
and Urals. In Asia numerous ranges also contained large
glaciers, but practically all the glaciation was of the
alpine type and very little of the vast northern lowland
was covered with ice.</p>

<p>In the southern hemisphere glaciation at low latitudes
<!--File: cc156.png Page 132-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_132" title="pg 132"></a>
was less striking than in the northern hemisphere. Most
of the increase in the areas of ice was confined to mountains
which today receive heavy precipitation and still
contain small glaciers. Indeed, except for relatively slight
glaciation in the Australian Alps and in Tasmania, most
of the Pleistocene glaciation in the southern hemisphere
was merely an extension of existing glaciers, such as
those of south Chile, New Zealand, and the Andes. Nevertheless,
fairly extensive glaciation existed much nearer
the equator than is now the case.</p>

<p>In considering the localization of Pleistocene glaciation,
three main factors must be taken into account,
namely, temperature, topography, and precipitation. The
absence of glaciation in large parts of the Arctic regions
of North America and of Asia makes it certain that low
temperature was not the controlling factor. Aside from
Antarctica, the coldest place in the world is northeastern
Siberia. There for seven months the average temperature
is below 0&deg;C., while the mean for the whole year is
below -10&deg;C. If the temperature during a glacial period
averaged 6&deg;C. lower than now, as is commonly supposed,
this part of Siberia would have had a temperature below
freezing for at least nine months out of the twelve even if
there were no snowfield to keep the summers cold. Yet
even under such conditions no glaciation occurred, although
in other places, such as parts of Canada and
northwestern Europe, intense glaciation occurred where
the mean temperature is much higher.</p>

<p>The topography of the lands apparently had much
more influence upon the localization of glaciation than
did temperature. Its effect, however, was always to cause
glaciation exactly where it would be expected and not in
unexpected places as actually occurred. For example, in
North America the western side of the Canadian Rockies
<!--File: cc157.png Page 133-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_133" title="pg 133"></a>
suffered intense glaciation, for there precipitation was
heavy because the westerly winds from the Pacific are
forced to give up their moisture as they rise. In the same
way the western side of the Sierra Nevadas was much
more heavily glaciated than the eastern side. In similar
fashion the windward slopes of the Alps, the Caucasus,
the Himalayas, and many other mountain ranges suffered
extensive glaciation. Low temperature does not
seem to have been the cause of this glaciation, for in that
case it is hard to see why both sides of the various ranges
did not show an equal percentage of increase in the size
of their icefields.</p>

<p>From what has been said as to temperature and topography,
it is evident that variations in precipitation have
had much more to do with glaciation than have variations
in temperature. In the Arctic lowlands and on the leeward
side of mountains, the slight development of glaciation
appears to have been due to scarcity of precipitation.
On the windward side of mountains, on the other
hand, a notable increase in precipitation seems to have
led to abundant glaciation. Such an increase in precipitation
must be dependent on increased evaporation and
this could arise either from relatively high temperature
or strong winds. Since the temperature in the glacial
period was lower than now, we seem forced to attribute
the increased precipitation to a strengthening of the
winds. If the westerly winds from the Pacific should increase
in strength and waft more moisture to the western
side of the Canadian Rockies, or if similar winds increased
the snowfall on the upper slopes of the Alps or
the Tian-Shan Mountains, the glaciers would extend
lower than now without any change in temperature.</p>

<p>Although the incompetence of low temperature to cause
glaciation, and the relative unimportance of the mountains
<!--File: cc158.png Page 134-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_134" title="pg 134"></a>
in northeastern Canada and northwestern Europe
throw most glacial hypotheses out of court, they are in
harmony with the cyclonic hypothesis. The answer of
that hypothesis to the problem of the localization of ice
sheets seems to be found in certain maps of storminess
and rainfall in relation to solar activity. In Fig. 2 a
marked belt of increased storminess at times of many
sunspots is seen in southern Canada. A comparison of
this with a series of maps given in <em>Earth and Sun</em> shows
that the stormy belt tends to migrate northward in harmony
with an increase in the activity of the sun's atmosphere.
If the sun were sufficiently active the belt of
maximum storminess would apparently pass through the
Keewatin and Labradorean centers of glaciation instead
of well to the south of them, as at present. It would
presumably cross another center in Greenland, and then
would traverse the fourth of the great centers of Pleistocene
glaciation in Scandinavia. It would not succeed in
traversing northern Asia, however, any more than it
does now, because of the great high-pressure area which
develops there in winter. When the ice sheets expanded
from the main centers of glaciation, the belt of storms
would be pushed southward and outward. Thus it might
give rise to minor centers of glaciers such as the Patrician
between Hudson Bay and Lake Superior, or the
centers in Ireland, Cornwall, Wales, and the northern
Ural Mountains. As the main ice sheets advanced, however,
the minor centers would be overridden and the
entire mass of ice would be merged into one vast expanse
in the Atlantic portion of each of the two continents.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be well to consider briefly the
most recent hypothesis as to the growth and hence the
localization of glaciation. In 1911 and more fully in 1915,
<!--File: cc159.png Page 135-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_135" title="pg 135"></a>
Hobbs,<sup><a href="#fn48" id="r48">[48]</a></sup> advanced the anti-cyclonic hypothesis of the
origin of ice sheets. This hypothesis has the great merit
of focusing attention upon the fact that ice sheets are
pronounced anti-cyclonic regions of high pressure. This
is proved by the strong outblowing winds which prevail
along their margins. Such winds must, of course, be
balanced by inward-moving winds at high levels. Abundant
observations prove that such is the case. For
example, balloons sent up by Barkow near the margin of
the Antarctic ice sheet reveal the occurrence of inblowing
winds, although they rarely occur below a height of
9000 meters. The abundant data gathered by Guervain
on the coast of Greenland indicate that outblowing winds
prevail up to a height of about 4000 meters. At that
height inblowing winds commence and increase in frequency
until at an altitude of over 5000 meters they become
more common than outblowing winds. It should be
noted, however, that in both Antarctica and Greenland,
although the winds at an elevation of less than a thousand
meters generally blow outward, there are frequent and
decided departures from this rule, so that "variable
winds" are quite commonly mentioned in the reports of
expeditions and balloon soundings.</p>

<p>The undoubted anti-cyclonic conditions which Hobbs
thus calls to the attention of scientists seem to him to
necessitate a peculiar mechanism in order to produce
the snow which feeds the glaciers. He assumes that the
winds which blow toward the centers of the ice sheets
at high levels carry the necessary moisture by which the
glaciers grow. When the air descends in the centers of
the highs, it is supposed to be chilled on reaching the surface
<!--File: cc160.png Page 136-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_136" title="pg 136"></a>
of the ice, and hence to give up its moisture in the
form of minute crystals. This conclusion is doubtful for
several reasons. In the first place, Hobbs does not seem
to appreciate the importance of the variable winds which
he quotes Arctic and Antarctic explorers as describing
quite frequently on the edges of the ice sheets. They are
one of many signs that cyclonic storms are fairly frequent
on the borders of the ice though not in its interior.
Thus there is a distinct and sufficient form of precipitation
actually at work near the margin of the ice, or
exactly where the thickness of the ice sheet would lead
us to expect.</p>

<p>Another consideration which throws grave doubt on
the anti-cyclonic hypothesis of ice sheets is the small
amount of moisture possible in the highs because of their
low temperature. Suppose, for the sake of argument,
that the temperature in the middle of an ice sheet averages
20&deg;F. This is probably much higher than the actual
fact and therefore unduly favorable to the anti-cyclonic
hypothesis. Suppose also that the decrease in temperature
from the earth's surface upward proceeds at the
rate of 1&deg;F. for each 300 feet, which is 50 per cent less
than the actual rate for air with only a slight amount of
moisture, such as is found in cold regions. Then at a
height of 10,000 feet, where the inblowing winds begin
to be felt, the temperature would be -20&deg;F. At that
temperature the air is able to hold approximately 0.166
grain of moisture per cubic foot when fully saturated.
This is an exceedingly small amount of moisture and even
if it were all precipitated could scarcely build a glacier.
However, it apparently would not be precipitated because
when such air descends in the center of the anti-cyclone
it is warmed adiabatically, that is, by compression. On
reaching the surface it would have a temperature of 20&deg;
<!--File: cc161.png Page 137-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_137" title="pg 137"></a>
and would be able to hold 0.898 grain of water vapor per
cubic foot; in other words, it would have a relative humidity
of about 18 per cent. Under no reasonable assumption
does the upper air at the center of an ice sheet
appear to reach the surface with a relative humidity of
more than 20 or 25 per cent. Such air cannot give up
moisture. On the contrary, it absorbs it and tends to
diminish rather than increase the thickness of the sheet
of ice and snow. But after the surplus heat gained by
descent has been lost by radiation, conduction, and
evaporation, the air may become super-saturated with
the moisture picked up while warm. Hobbs reports that
explorers in Antarctica and Greenland have frequently
observed condensation on their clothing. If such moisture
is not derived directly from the men's own bodies, it is
apparently picked up from the ice sheet by the descending
air, and not added to the ice sheet by air from aloft.</p>

<p>The relation of all this to the localization of ice sheets
is this. If Hobbs' anti-cyclonic hypothesis of glacial
growth is correct, it would appear that ice sheets should
grow up where the temperature is lowest and the high-pressure
areas most persistent; for instance, in northern
Siberia. It would also appear that so far as the topography
permitted, the ice sheets ought to move out uniformly
in all directions; hence the ice sheet ought to be
as prominent to the north of the Keewatin and Labradorean
centers as to the south, which is by no means the
case. Again, in mountainous regions, such as the glacial
areas of Alaska and Chile, the glaciation ought not to
be confined to the windward slope of the mountains so
closely as is actually the fact. In each of these cases the
glaciated region was large enough so that there was
probably a true anti-cyclonic area comparable with that
now prevailing over southern Greenland. In both places
<!--File: cc162.png Page 138-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_138" title="pg 138"></a>
the correlation between glaciation and mountain ranges
seems much too close to support the anti-cyclonic hypothesis,
for the inblowing winds which on that hypothesis
bring the moisture are shown by observation to occur
at heights far greater than that of all but the loftiest
ranges.</p>

<p>II. The sudden coming of glaciation is another problem
which has been a stumbling-block in the way of every
glacial hypothesis. In his <em>Climates of Geologic Times</em>,
Schuchert states that the fossils give almost no warning
of an approaching catastrophe. If glaciation were solely
due to uplift, or other terrestrial changes aside from vulcanism,
Schuchert holds that it would have come slowly
and the stages preceding glaciation would have affected
life sufficiently to be recorded in the rocks. He considers
that the suddenness of the coming of glaciation is one
of the strongest arguments against the carbon dioxide
hypothesis of glaciation.</p>

<p>According to the cyclonic hypothesis, however, the
suddenness of the oncoming of glaciation is merely what
would be expected on the basis of what happens today.
Changes in the sun occur suddenly. The sunspot cycle is
only eleven or twelve years long, and even this short
period of activity is inaugurated more suddenly than it
declines. Again the climatic record derived from the
growth of trees, as given in Figs. 4 and 5, also shows that
marked changes in climate are initiated more rapidly
than they disappear. In this connection, however, it must
be remembered that solar activity may arise in various
ways, as will appear more fully later. Under certain conditions
storminess may increase and decrease slowly.</p>

<p>III. The height of the snow line and of glaciation furnishes
another means of testing glacial hypotheses. It is
well established that in times of glaciation the snow line
<!--File: cc163.png Page 139-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_139" title="pg 139"></a>
was depressed everywhere, but least near the equator.
For example, according to Penck, permanent snow extended
4000 feet lower than now in the Alps, whereas
it stood only 1500 feet below the present level near the
equator in Venezuela. This unequal depression is not
readily accounted for by any hypothesis depending solely
upon the lowering of temperature. By the carbon dioxide
and the volcanic dust hypotheses, the temperature presumably
was lowered almost equally in all latitudes, but
a little more at the equator than elsewhere. If glaciation
were due to a temporary lessening of the radiation received
from the sun, such as is demanded by the thermal
solar hypothesis, and by the longer periods of Croll's
hypothesis, the lowering would be distinctly greatest at
the equator. Thus, according to all these hypotheses, the
snow line should have been depressed most at the equator,
instead of least.</p>

<p>The cyclonic hypothesis explains the lesser depression
of the snow line at the equator as due to a diminution of
precipitation. The effectiveness of precipitation in this
respect is illustrated by the present great difference in
the height of the snow line on the humid and dry sides of
mountains. On the wet eastern side of the Andes near the
equator, the snow line lies at 16,000 feet; on the dry
western side, at 18,500 feet. Again, although the humid
side of the Himalayas lies toward the south, the snow line
has a level of 15,000 feet, while farther north, on the dry
side, it is 16,700 feet.<sup><a href="#fn49" id="r49">[49]</a></sup> The fact that the snow line is lower
near the margin of the Alps than toward the center
points in the same direction. The bearing of all this on
the glacial period may be judged by looking again at Fig.
3 in Chapter V. This shows that at times of sunspot
activity and hence of augmented storminess, the precipitation
<!--File: cc164.png Page 140-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_140" title="pg 140"></a>
diminishes near the heat equator, that is, where
the average temperature for the whole year is highest.
At present the great size of the northern continents and
their consequent high temperature in summer, cause the
heat equator to lie north of the "real" equator, except
where Australia draws it to the southward.<sup><a href="#fn50" id="r50">[50]</a></sup> When large
parts of the northern continents were covered with ice,
however, the heat equator and the true equator were
probably much closer than now, for the continents could
not become so hot. If so, the diminution in equatorial
precipitation, which accompanies increased storminess
throughout the world as a whole, would take place more
nearly along the true equator than appears in Fig. 3.
Hence so far as precipitation alone is concerned, we
should actually expect that the snow line near the equator
would rise a little during glacial periods. Another factor,
however, must be considered. K&ouml;ppen's data, it will be
remembered, show that at times of solar activity the
earth's temperature falls more at the equator than in
higher latitudes. If this effect were magnified it would
lower the snow line. The actual position of the snow line
at the equator during glacial periods thus appears to be
the combined effect of diminished precipitation, which
would raise the line, and of lower temperature, which
would bring it down.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject it may be well to recall that
the relative lessening of precipitation in equatorial latitudes
during the glacial epochs was probably caused by
the diversion of moisture from the trade-wind belt. This
diversion was presumably due to the great number of
tropical cyclones and to the fact that the cyclonic storms
of middle latitudes also drew much moisture from the
trade-wind belt in summer when the northern position of
<!--File: cc165.png Page 141-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_141" title="pg 141"></a>
the sun drew that belt near the storm track which was
forced to remain south of the ice sheet. Such diversion
of moisture out of the trade-wind belt must diminish the
amount of water vapor that is carried by the trades to
equatorial regions; hence it would lessen precipitation
in the belt of so-called equatorial calms, which lies along
the heat equator rather than along the geographical
equator.</p>

<p>Another phase of the vertical distribution of glaciation
has been the subject of considerable discussion. In the
Alps and in many other mountains the glaciation of the
Pleistocene period appears to have had its upper limit
no higher than today. This has been variously interpreted.
It seems, however, to be adequately explained
as due to decreased precipitation at high altitudes during
the cold periods. This is in spite of the fact that precipitation
in general increased with increased storminess.
The low temperature of glacial times presumably induced
condensation at lower altitudes than now, and most of
the precipitation occurred upon the lower slopes of the
mountains, contributing to the lower glaciers, while little
of it fell upon the highest glaciers. Above a moderate
altitude in all lofty mountains the decrease in the amount
of precipitation is rapid. In most cases the decrease
begins at a height of less than 3000 feet above the base
of the main slope, provided the slope is steep. The colder
the air, the lower the altitude at which this occurs. For
example, it is much lower in winter than in summer.
Indeed, the higher altitudes in the Alps are sunny in
winter even where there are abundant clouds lower down.</p>

<p>IV. The presence of extensive lakes and other evidences
of a pluvial climate during glacial periods in non-glaciated
regions which are normally dry is another of the
facts which most glacial hypotheses fail to explain satisfactorily.
<!--File: cc166.png Page 142-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_142" title="pg 142"></a>
Beyond the ice sheets many regions appear to
have enjoyed an unusually heavy precipitation during the
glacial epochs. The evidence of this is abundant, including
numerous abandoned strand lines of salt lakes and an
abundance of coarse material in deltas and flood plains.J. D. Whitney,<sup><a href="#fn51" id="r51">[51]</a></sup> in an interesting but neglected volume,
was one of the first to marshal the evidence of this sort.
More recently Free<sup><a href="#fn52" id="r52">[52]</a></sup> has amplified this. According to him
in the Great Basin region of the United States sixty-two
basins either contain unmistakable evidence of lakes, or
belong to one of the three great lake groups named below.
Two of these, the Lake Lahontan and the Lake Bonneville
groups, comprise twenty-nine present basins, while
the third, the Owens-Searles chain, contained at least
five large lakes, the lowest being in Death Valley. In
western and central Asia a far greater series of salt lakes
is found and most of these are surrounded by strands at
high levels. Many of these are described in <em>Explorations
in Turkestan</em>, <em>The Pulse of Asia</em>, and <em>Palestine and Its
Transformation</em>. There has been a good deal of debate as
to whether these lakes actually date from the glacial
period, as is claimed by C. E. P. Brooks, for example, or
from some other period. The evidence, however, seems to
be convincing that the lakes expanded when the ice also
expanded.</p>

<p>According to the older glacial hypotheses the lower
temperature which is postulated as the cause of glaciation
would almost certainly mean less evaporation over
the oceans and hence less precipitation during glacial
periods. To counteract this the only way in which the
<!--File: cc167.png Page 143-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_143" title="pg 143"></a>
level of the lakes could be raised would be because the
lower temperature would cause less evaporation from
their surfaces. It seems quite impossible, however, that
the lowering of temperature, which is commonly taken
to have been not more than 10&deg;C., could counteract the
lessened precipitation and also cause an enormous expansion
of most of the lakes. For example, ancient Lake
Bonneville was more than ten times as large as its
modern remnant, Great Salt Lake, and its average depth
more than forty times as great.<sup><a href="#fn53" id="r53">[53]</a></sup> Many small lakes in the
Old World expanded still more.<sup><a href="#fn54" id="r54">[54]</a></sup> For example, in eastern
Persia many basins which now contain no lake whatever
are floored with vast deposits of lacustrine salt and are
surrounded by old lake bluffs and beaches. In northern
Africa similar conditions prevail.<sup><a href="#fn55" id="r55">[55]</a></sup> Other, but less obvious,
evidence of more abundant rainfall in regions that
are now dry is found in thick strata of gravel, sand, and
fine silt in the alluvial deposits of flood plains and deltas.<sup><a href="#fn56" id="r56">[56]</a></sup></p>

<p>The cyclonic hypothesis supposes that increased
storminess accounts for pluvial climates in regions that
are now dry just as it accounts for glaciation in the
regions of the ice sheets. Figs. 2 and 3, it will be remembered,
illustrate what happens when the sun is active.
Solar activity is accompanied by an increase in storminess
in the southwestern United States in exactly the region
where elevated strands of diminished salt lakes are
most numerous. In Fig. 3, the same condition is seen in
<!--File: cc168.png Page 144-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_144" title="pg 144"></a>
the region of salt lakes in the Old World. Judging by
these maps, which illustrate what has happened since
careful meteorological records were kept, an increase in
solar activity is accompanied by increased rainfall in
large parts of what are now semi-arid and desert regions.
Such precipitation would at once cause the level of the
lakes to rise. Later, when ice sheets had developed in
Europe and America, the high-pressure areas thus caused
might force the main storm belt so far south that it would
lie over these same arid regions. The increase in tropical
hurricanes at times of abundant sunspots may also have
a bearing on the climate of regions that are now arid.
During the glacial period some of the hurricanes probably
swept far over the lands. The numerous tropical
cyclones of Australia, for example, are the chief source
of precipitation for that continent.<sup><a href="#fn57" id="r57">[57]</a></sup> Some of the stronger
cyclones locally yield more rain in a day or two than
other sources yield in a year.</p>

<p>V. The occurrence of widespread glaciation near the
tropics during the Permian, as shown in Fig. 7, has given
rise to much discussion. The recent discovery of glaciation
in latitudes as low as 30&deg; in the Proterozoic is correspondingly
significant. In all cases the occurrence of
glaciation in low and middle latitudes is probably due to
the same general causes. Doubtless the position and altitude
of the mountains had something to do with the
matter. Yet taken by itself this seems insufficient. Today
the loftiest range in the world, the Himalayas, is almost
unglaciated, although its southern slope may seem at first
thought to be almost ideally located in this respect. Some
parts rise over 20,000 feet and certain lower slopes receive
400 inches of rain per year. The small size of the
Himalayan glaciers in spite of these favorable conditions
<!--File: cc169.png Page 145-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_145" title="pg 145"></a>

<!--File: cc170.png Page 146-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_146" title="pg 146"></a>
is apparently due largely to the seasonal character of the
monsoon winds. The strong outblowing monsoons of
winter cause about half the year to be very dry with clear
skies and dry winds from the interior of Asia. In all low
latitudes the sun rides high in the heavens at midday,
even in winter, and thus melts snow fairly effectively in
clear weather. This is highly unfavorable to glaciation.
The inblowing southern monsoons bring all their moisture
in midsummer at just the time when it is least effective
in producing snow. Conditions similar to those now
prevailing in the Himalayas must accompany any great
uplift of the lands which produces high mountains and
large continents in subtropical and middle latitudes.
Hence, uplift alone cannot account for extensive glaciation
in subtropical latitudes during the Permian and
Proterozoic.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Fig. 7. Permian geography and glaciation.<br />
(After Schuchert.)</em></p>

<p>The assumption of a great general lowering of temperature
is also not adequate to explain glaciation in
subtropical latitudes. In the first place this would require
a lowering of many degrees,&mdash;far more than in the Pleistocene
glacial period. The marine fossils of the Permian,
however, do not indicate any such condition. In the
second place, if the lands were widespread as they appear
to have been in the Permian, a general lowering of
temperature would diminish rather than increase the
present slight efficiency of the monsoons in producing
glaciation. Monsoons depend upon the difference between
the temperatures of land and water. If the general temperature
were lowered, the reduction would be much less
pronounced on the oceans than on the lands, for water
tends to preserve a uniform temperature, not only because
of its mobility, but because of the large amount of
heat given out when freezing takes place, or consumed in
evaporation. Hence the general lowering of temperature
<!--File: cc171.png Page 147-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_147" title="pg 147"></a>
would make the contrast between continents and oceans
less than at present in summer, for the land temperature
would be brought toward that of the ocean. This would
diminish the strength of the inblowing summer monsoons
and thus cut off part of the supply of moisture.
Evidence that this actually happened in the cold fourteenth
century has already been given in Chapter VI.
On the other hand, in winter the lands would be much
colder than now and the oceans only a little colder, so
that the dry outblowing monsoons of the cold season
would increase in strength and would also last longer
than at present. In addition to all this, the mere fact of
low temperature would mean a general reduction in the
amount of water vapor in the air. Thus, from almost
every point of view a mere lowering of temperature
seems to be ruled out as a cause of Permian glaciation.
Moreover, if the Permian or Proterozoic glacial periods
were so cold that the lands above latitude 30&deg; were snow-covered
most of the time, the normal surface winds in
subtropical latitudes would be largely equatorward, just
as the winter monsoons now are. Hence little or no moisture
would be available to feed the snowfields which give
rise to the glaciers.</p>

<p>It has been assumed by Marsden Manson and others
that increased general cloudiness would account for the
subtropical glaciation of the Permian and Proterozoic.
Granting for the moment that there could be universal
persistent cloudiness, this would not prevent or counteract
the outblowing anti-cyclonic winds so characteristic
of great snowfields. Therefore, under the hypothesis of
general cloudiness there would be no supply of moisture
to cause glaciation in low latitudes. Indeed, persistent
cloudiness in all higher latitudes would apparently deprive
the Himalayas of most of their present moisture,
<!--File: cc172.png Page 148-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_148" title="pg 148"></a>
for the interior of Asia would not become hot in summer
and no inblowing monsoons would develop. In fact, winds
of all kinds would seemingly be scarce, for they arise
almost wholly from contrasts of temperature and hence
of atmospheric pressure. The only way to get winds and
hence precipitation would be to invoke some other agency,
such as cyclonic storms, but that would be a departure
from the supposition that glaciation arose from cloudiness.</p>

<p>Let us now inquire how the cyclonic hypothesis
accounts for glaciation in low latitudes. We will first
consider the terrestrial conditions in the early Permian,
the last period of glaciation in such latitudes. Geologists
are almost universally agreed that the lands were exceptionally
extensive and also high, especially in low latitudes.
One evidence of this is the presence of abundant
conglomerates composed of great boulders. It is also
probable that the carbon dioxide in the air during the
early Permian had been reduced to a minimum by the
extraordinary amount of coal formed during the preceding
period. This would tend to produce low temperature
and thus make the conditions favorable for glaciation as
soon as an accentuation of solar activity caused unusual
storminess. If the storminess became extreme when terrestrial
conditions were thus universally favorable to
glaciation, it would presumably produce glaciation in low
latitudes. Numerous and intense tropical cyclones would
carry a vast amount of moisture out of the tropics, just
as now happens when the sun is active, but on a far
larger scale. The moisture would be precipitated on the
equatorward slopes of the subtropical mountain ranges.
At high elevations this precipitation would be in the form
of snow even in summer. Tropical cyclones, however, as
is shown in <em>Earth and Sun</em>, occur in the autumn and
<!--File: cc173.png Page 149-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_149" title="pg 149"></a>
winter as well as in summer. For example, in the Bay of
Bengal the number recorded in October is fifty, the
largest for any month; while in November it is thirty-four,
and December fourteen as compared with an average
of forty-two for the months of July to September.
From January to March, when sunspot numbers averaged
more than forty, the number of tropical hurricanes
was 143 per cent greater than when the sunspot numbers
averaged below forty. During the months from April to
June, which also would be times of considerable snowy
precipitation, tropical hurricanes averaged 58 per cent
more numerous with sunspot numbers above forty than
with numbers below forty, while from July to September
the difference amounted to 23 per cent. Even at this
season some snow falls on the higher slopes, while the
increased cloudiness due to numerous storms also tends
to preserve the snow. Thus a great increase in the frequency
of sunspots is accompanied by increased intensity
of tropical hurricanes, especially in the cooler autumn and
spring months, and results not only in a greater accumulation
of snow but in a decrease in the melting of the
snow because of more abundant clouds. At such times as
the Permian, the general low temperature due to rapid
convection and to the scarcity of carbon dioxide presumably
joined with the extension of the lands in producing
great high-pressure areas over the lands in middle
latitudes during the winters, and thus caused the more
northern, or mid-latitude type of cyclonic storms to be
shifted to the equatorward side of the continents at that
season. This would cause an increase of precipitation in
winter as well as during the months when tropical hurricanes
abound. Many other circumstances would co&ouml;perate
to produce a similar result. For example, the general
low temperature would cause the sea to be covered with
<!--File: cc174.png Page 150-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_150" title="pg 150"></a>
ice in lower latitudes than now, and would help to create
high-pressure areas in middle latitudes, thus driving the
storms far south. If the sea water were fresher than now,
as it probably was to a notable extent in the Proterozoic
and perhaps to some slight extent in the Permian, the
higher freezing point would also further the extension
of the ice and help to keep the storms away from high
latitudes. If to this there is added a distribution of land
and sea such that the volume of the warm ocean currents
flowing from low to high latitudes was diminished, as
appears to have been the case, there seems to be no difficulty
in explaining the subtropical location of the main
glaciation in both the Permian and the Proterozoic. An
increase of storminess seems to be the key to the whole
situation.</p>

<p>One other possibility may be mentioned, although little
stress should be laid on it. In <em>Earth and Sun</em> it has been
shown that the main storm track in both the northern
and southern hemispheres is not concentric with the
geographical poles. Both tracks are roughly concentric
with the corresponding magnetic poles, a fact which may
be important in connection with the hypothesis of an electrical
effect of the sun upon terrestrial storminess. The
magnetic poles are known to wander considerably. Such
wandering gives rise to variations in the direction of
the magnetic needle from year to year. In 1815 the compass
in England pointed 24-&frac12;&deg; W. of N. and in 1906
17&deg; 45' W. Such a variation seems to mean a change of
many miles in the location of the north magnetic pole.
Certain changes in the daily march of electromagnetic
phenomena over the oceans have led Bauer and his associates
to suggest that the magnetic poles may even be
subject to a slight daily movement in response to the
changes in the relative positions of the earth and sun.
<!--File: cc175.png Page 151-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_151" title="pg 151"></a>
Thus there seems to be a possibility that a pronounced
change in the location of the magnetic pole in Permian
times, for example, may have had some connection with
a shifting in the location of the belt of storms. It must be
clearly understood that there is as yet no evidence of any
such change, and the matter is introduced merely to call
attention to a possible line of investigation.</p>

<p>Any hypothesis of Permian and Proterozoic glaciation
must explain not only the glaciation of low latitudes but
the lack of glaciation and the accumulation of red desert
beds in high latitudes. The facts already presented seem
to explain this. Glaciation could not occur extensively in
high latitudes partly because during most of the year the
air was too cold to hold much moisture, but still more
because the winds for the most part must have blown
outward from the cold northern areas and the cyclonic
storm belt was pushed out of high latitudes. Because of
these conditions precipitation was apparently limited to
a relatively small number of storms during the summer.
Hence great desert areas must have prevailed at high
latitudes. Great aridity now prevails north of the Himalayas
and related ranges, and red beds are accumulating
in the centers of the great deserts, such as those of the
Tarim Basin and the Transcaspian. The redness is not
due to the original character of the rock, but to intense
oxidation, as appears from the fact that along the edges
of the desert and wherever occasional floods carry sediment
far out into the midst of the sand, the material has
the ordinary brownish shades. As soon as one goes out
into the places where the sand has been exposed to the air
for a long time, however, it becomes pink, and then red.
Such conditions may have given rise to the high degree
of oxidation in the famous Permian red beds. If the air
of the early Permian contained an unusual percentage of
<!--File: cc176.png Page 152-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_152" title="pg 152"></a>
oxygen because of the release of that gas by the great
plant beds which formed coal in the preceding era, as
Chamberlin has thought probable, the tendency to produce
red beds would be still further increased.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that these conditions
would absolutely limit glaciation to subtropical
latitudes. The presence of early Permian glaciation in
North America at Boston and in Alaska and in the Falkland
Islands of the South Atlantic Ocean proves that at
least locally there was sufficient moisture to form glaciers
near the coast in relatively high latitudes. The possibility
of this would depend entirely upon the form of the lands
and the consequent course of ocean currents. Even in
those high latitudes cyclonic storms would occur unless
they were kept out by conditions of pressure such as have
been described above.</p>

<p>The marine faunas of Permian age in high latitudes
have been interpreted as indicating mild oceanic temperatures.
This is a point which requires further investigation.
Warm oceans during times of slight solar activity
are a necessary consequence of the cyclonic hypothesis,
as will appear later. The present cold oceans seem to be
the expectable result of the Pleistocene glaciation and of
the present relatively disturbed condition of the sun. If
a sudden disturbance threw the solar atmosphere into
violent commotion within a few thousand years during
Permian times, glaciation might occur as described above,
while the oceans were still warm. In fact their warmth
would increase evaporation while the violent cyclonic
storms and high winds would cause heavy rain and keep
the air cool by constantly raising it to high levels where
it would rapidly radiate its heat into space.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is not yet possible to determine how
warm the oceans were at the actual time of the Permian
<!--File: cc177.png Page 153-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_153" title="pg 153"></a>
glaciation. Some faunas formerly reported as Permian
are now known to be considerably older. Moreover, others
of undoubted Permian age are probably not strictly contemporaneous
with the glaciation. So far back in the
geological record it is very doubtful whether we can date
fossils within the limits of say 100,000 years. Yet a difference
of 100,000 years would be more than enough to
allow the fossils to have lived either before or after the
glaciation, or in an inter-glacial epoch. One such epoch
is known to have occurred and nine others are suggested
by the inter-stratification of glacial till and marine sediments
in eastern Australia. The warm currents which
would flow poleward in inter-glacial epochs must have
favored a prompt reintroduction of marine faunas driven
out during times of glaciation. Taken all and all, the
Permian glaciation seems to be accounted for by the
cyclonic hypothesis quite as well as does the Pleistocene.
In both these cases, as well as in the various pulsations
of historic times, it seems to be necessary merely to magnify
what is happening today in order to reproduce the
conditions which prevailed in the past. If the conditions
which now prevail at times of sunspot minima were magnified,
they would give the mild conditions of inter-glacial
epochs and similar periods. If the conditions which now
prevail at times of sunspot maxima are magnified a little
they seem to produce periods of climatic stress such as
those of the fourteenth century. If they are magnified
still more the result is apparently glacial epochs like
those of the Pleistocene, and if they are magnified to a
still greater extent, the result is Permian or Proterozoic
glaciation. Other factors must indeed be favorable, for
climatic changes are highly complex and are unquestionably
due to a combination of circumstances. The point
which is chiefly emphasized in this book is that among
<!--File: cc178.png Page 154-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_154" title="pg 154"></a>
those several circumstances, changes in cyclonic storms
due apparently to activity of the sun's atmosphere must
always be reckoned.</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF LOESS</h3>


<p>One of the most remarkable formations associated
with glacial deposits consists of vast sheets
of the fine-grained, yellowish, wind-blown material
called loess. Somewhat peculiar climatic conditions
evidently prevailed when it was formed. At present
similar deposits are being laid down only near the leeward
margin of great deserts. The famous loess deposits
of China in the lee of the Desert of Gobi are examples.
During the Pleistocene period, however, loess accumulated
in a broad zone along the margin of the ice sheet
at its maximum extent. In the Old World it extended
from France across Germany and through the Black
Earth region of Russia into Siberia. In the New World
a still larger area is loess-covered. In the Mississippi
Valley, tens of thousands of square miles are mantled by
a layer exceeding twenty feet in thickness and in many
places approaching a hundred feet. Neither the North
American nor the European deposits are associated with
a desert. Indeed, loess is lacking in the western and
drier parts of the great plains and is best developed in
the well-watered states of Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri.
Part of the loess overlies the non-glacial materials of the
great central plain, but the northern portions overlie the
drift deposits of the first three glaciations. A few traces
of loess are associated with the Kansan and Illinoian,
the second and third glaciations, but most of the American
<!--File: cc180.png Page 156-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_156" title="pg 156"></a>
loess appears to have been formed at approximately
the time of the Iowan or fourth glaciation, while only a
little overlies the drift sheets of the Wisconsin age. The
loess is thickest near the margin of the Iowan till sheet
and thins progressively both north and south. The
thinning southward is abrupt along the stream divides,
but very gradual along the larger valleys. Indeed, loess is
abundant along the bluffs of the Mississippi, especially
the east bluff, almost to the Gulf of Mexico.<sup><a href="#fn58" id="r58">[58]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is now generally agreed that all typical loess is wind
blown. There is still much question, however, as to its
time of origin, and thus indirectly as to its climatic implications.
Several American and European students
have thought that the loess dates from inter-glacial times.
On the other hand, Penck has concluded that the loess
was formed shortly before the commencement of the
glacial epochs; while many American geologists hold that
the loess accumulated while the ice sheets were at approximately
their maximum size. W. J. McGee, Chamberlin
and Salisbury, Keyes, and others lean toward this
view. In this chapter the hypothesis is advanced that it
was formed at the one other possible time, namely, immediately
following the retreat of the ice.</p>

<p>These four hypotheses as to the time of origin of loess
imply the following differences in its climatic relations.
If loess was formed during typical inter-glacial epochs,
or toward the close of such epochs, profound general
aridity must seemingly have prevailed in order to kill
off the vegetation and thus enable the wind to pick up
sufficient dust. If the loess was formed during times of
extreme glaciation when the glaciers were supplying
large quantities of fine material to outflowing streams,
less aridity would be required, but there must have been
<!--File: cc181.png Page 157-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_157" title="pg 157"></a>
sharp contrasts between wet seasons in summer when
the snow was melting and dry seasons in winter when
the storms were forced far south by the glacial high pressure.
Alternate floods and droughts would thus affect
broad areas along the streams. Hence arises the hypothesis
that the wind obtained the loess from the flood plains
of streams at times of maximum glaciation. If the loess
was formed during the rapid retreat of the ice, alternate
summer floods and winter droughts would still prevail,
but much material could also be obtained by the winds
not only from flood plains, but also from the deposits
exposed by the melting of the ice and not yet covered by
vegetation.</p>

<p>The evidence for and against the several hypotheses
may be stated briefly. In support of the hypothesis of the
inter-glacial origin of loess, Shimek and others state that
the glacial drift which lies beneath the loess commonly
gives evidence that some time elapsed between the disappearance
of the ice and the deposition of the loess. For
example, abundant shells of land snails in the loess are
not of the sort now found in colder regions, but resemble
those found in the drier regions. It is probable that if
they represented a glacial epoch they would be depauperated
by the cold as are the snails of far northern regions.
The gravel pavement discussed below seems to be strong
evidence of erosion between the retreat of the ice and
the deposition of the loess.</p>

<p>Turning to the second hypothesis, namely, that the
loess accumulated near the close of the inter-glacial epoch
rather than in the midst of it, we may follow Penck. The
mammalian fossils seem to him to prove that the loess
was formed while boreal animals occupied the region, for
they include remains of the hairy mammoth, woolly rhinoceros,
and reindeer. On the other hand, the typical
<!--File: cc182.png Page 158-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_158" title="pg 158"></a>
inter-glacial beds not far away yield remains of species
characteristic of milder climates, such as the elephant,
the smaller rhinoceros, and the deer. In connection with
these facts it should be noted that occasional remains of
tundra vegetation and of trees are found beneath the
loess, while in the loess itself certain steppe animals,
such as the common gopher or spermaphyl, are found.
Penck interprets this as indicating a progressive desiccation
culminating just before the oncoming of the next ice
sheet.</p>

<p>The evidence advanced in favor of the hypothesis that
the loess was formed when glaciation was near its maximum
includes the fact that if the loess does not represent
the outwash from the Iowan ice, there is little else that
does, and presumably there must have been outwash.
Also the distribution of loess along the margins of
streams suggests that much of the material came from
the flood plains of overloaded streams flowing from the
melting ice.</p>

<p>Although there are some points in favor of the hypothesis
that the loess originated (1) in strictly inter-glacial
times, (2) at the end of inter-glacial epochs, and
(3) at times of full glaciation, each hypothesis is much
weakened by evidence that supports the others. The evidence
of boreal animals seems to disprove the hypothesis
that the loess was formed in the middle of a mild inter-glacial
epoch. On the other hand, Penck's hypothesis as
to loess at the end of inter-glacial times fails to account
for certain characteristics of the lowest part of the loess
deposits and of the underlying topography. Instead of
normal valleys and consequent prompt drainage such as
ought to have developed before the end of a long inter-glacial
epoch, the surface on which the loess lies shows
many undrained depressions. Some of these can be seen
<!--File: cc183.png Page 159-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_159" title="pg 159"></a>
in exposed banks, while many more are inferred from the
presence of shells of pond snails here and there in the
overlying loess. The pond snails presumably lived in
shallow pools occupying depressions in the uneven surface
left by the ice. Another reason for questioning
whether the loess was formed at the end of an inter-glacial
epoch is that this hypothesis does not provide a
reasonable origin for the material which composes the
loess. Near the Alps where the loess deposits are small
and where glaciers probably persisted in the inter-glacial
epochs and thus supplied flood plain material in large
quantities, this does not appear important. In the broad
upper Mississippi Basin, however, and also in the Black
Earth region of Russia there seems to be no way to get
the large body of material composing the loess except by
assuming the existence of great deserts to windward.
But there seems to be little or no evidence of such deserts
where they could be effective. The mineralogical character
of the loess of Iowan age proves that the material
came from granitic rocks, such as formed a large part of
the drift. The nearest extensive outcrops of granite are
in the southwestern part of the United States, nearly a
thousand miles from Iowa and Illinois. But the loess is
thickest near the ice margin and thins toward the southwest
and in other directions, whereas if its source were
the southwestern desert, its maximum thickness would
probably be near the margin of the desert.</p>

<p>The evidence cited above seems inconsistent not only
with the hypothesis that the loess was formed at the end
of an inter-glacial epoch, but also with the idea that it
originated at times of maximum glaciation either from
river-borne sediments or from any other source. A
further and more convincing reason for this last conclusion
is the probability and almost the certainty that
<!--File: cc184.png Page 160-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_160" title="pg 160"></a>
when the ice advanced, its front lay close to areas where
the vegetation was not much thinner than that which
today prevails under similar climatic conditions. If the
average temperature of glacial maxima was only 6&deg;C.
lower than that of today, the conditions just beyond the
ice front when it was in the loess region from southern
Illinois to Minnesota would have been like those now prevailing
in Canada from New Brunswick to Winnipeg.
The vegetation there is quite different from the grassy,
semi-arid vegetation of which evidence is found in the
loess. The roots and stalks of such grassy vegetation are
generally agreed to have helped produce the columnar
structure which enables the loess to stand with almost
vertical surfaces.</p>

<p>We are now ready to consider the probability that loess
accumulated mainly during the retreat of the ice. Such a
retreat exposed a zone of drift to the outflowing glacial
winds. Most glacial hypotheses, such as that of uplift,
or depleted carbon dioxide, call for a gradual retreat
of the ice scarcely faster than the vegetation could advance
into the abandoned area. Under the solar-cyclonic
hypothesis, on the other hand, the climatic changes may
have been sudden and hence the retreat of the ice may
have been much more rapid than the advance of vegetation.
Now wind-blown materials are derived from places
where vegetation is scanty. Scanty vegetation on good
soil, it is true, is usually due to aridity, but may also
result because the time since the soil was exposed to the
air has not been long enough for the soil to be sufficiently
weathered to support vegetation. Even when weathering
has had full opportunity, as when sand bars, mud flats,
and flood plains are exposed, vegetation takes root only
slowly. Moreover, storms and violent winds may prevent
the spread of vegetation, as is seen on sandy beaches even
<!--File: cc185.png Page 161-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_161" title="pg 161"></a>
in distinctly humid regions like New Jersey and Denmark.
Thus it appears that unless the retreat of the ice
were as slow as the advance of vegetation, a barren area
of more or less width must have bordered the retreating
ice and formed an ideal source of loess.</p>

<p>Several other lines of evidence seemingly support the
conclusion that the loess was formed during the retreat
of the ice. For example, Shimek, who has made almost
a lifelong study of the Iowan loess, emphasizes the fact
that there is often an accumulation of stones and pebbles
at its base. This suggests that the underlying till was
eroded before the loess was deposited upon it. The first
reaction of most students is to assume that of course
this was due to running water. That is possible in many
cases, but by no means in all. So widespread a sheet of
gravel could not be deposited by streams without destroying
the irregular basins and hollows of which we have
seen evidence where the loess lies on glacial deposits. On
the other hand, the wind is competent to produce a similar
gravel pavement without disturbing the old topography.
"Desert pavements" are a notable feature in most
deserts. On the edges of an ice sheet, as Hobbs has made
us realize, the commonest winds are outward. They often
attain a velocity of eighty miles an hour in Antarctica
and Greenland. Such winds, however, usually decline
rapidly in velocity only a few score miles from the ice.
Thus their effect would be to produce rapid erosion
of the freshly bared surface near the retreating ice.
The pebbles would be left behind as a pavement, while
sand and then loess would be deposited farther from the
ice where the winds were weaker and where vegetation
was beginning to take root. Such a decrease in wind
velocity may explain the occasional vertical gradation
from gravel through sand to coarse loess and then to
<!--File: cc186.png Page 162-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_162" title="pg 162"></a>
normal fine loess. As the ice sheet retreated the wind in
any given place would gradually become less violent.
As the ice continued to retreat the area where loess was
deposited would follow at a distance, and thus each part
of the gravel pavement would in turn be covered with the
loess.</p>

<p>The hypothesis that loess is deposited while the ice is
retreating is in accord with many other lines of evidence.
For example, it accords with the boreal character of the
mammal remains as described above. Again, the advance
of vegetation into the barren zone along the front of the
ice would be delayed by the strong outblowing winds.
The common pioneer plants depend largely on the wind
for the distribution of their seeds, but the glacial winds
would carry them away from the ice rather than toward
it. The glacial winds discourage the advance of vegetation
in another way, for they are drying winds, as are
almost all winds blowing from a colder to a warmer
region. The fact that remains of trees sometimes occur
at the bottom of the loess probably means that the deposition
of loess extended into the forests which almost
certainly persisted not far from the ice. This seems more
likely than that a period of severe aridity before the advance
of the ice killed the trees and made a steppe or
desert. Penck's chief argument in favor of the formation
of loess before the advance of the ice rather than after,
is that since loess is lacking upon the youngest drift sheet
in Europe it must have been formed before rather than
after the last or W&uuml;rm advance of the ice. This breaks
down on two counts. First, on the corresponding (Wisconsin)
drift sheet in America, loess is present,&mdash;in small
quantities to be sure, but unmistakably present. Second,
there is no reason to assume that conditions were identical
at each advance and retreat of the ice. Indeed, the
<!--File: cc187.png Page 163-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_163" title="pg 163"></a>
fact that in Europe, as in the United States, nearly all
the loess was formed at one time, and only a little is associated
with the other ice advances, points clearly against
Penck's fundamental assumption that the accumulation
of loess was due to the approach of a cold climate.</p>

<p>Having seen that the loess was probably formed during
the retreat of the ice, we are now ready to inquire what
conditions the cyclonic hypothesis would postulate in the
loess areas during the various stages of a glacial cycle.
Fig. 2, in Chapter IV, gives the best idea of what would
apparently happen in North America, and events in Europe
would presumably be similar. During the nine maximum
years on which Fig. 2 is based the sunspot numbers averaged
seventy, while during the nine minimum years they
averaged less than five. It seems fair to suppose that the
maximum years represent the average conditions which
prevailed in the past at times when the sun was in a
median stage between the full activity which led to glaciation
and the mild activity of the minimum years which
appear to represent inter-glacial conditions. This would
mean that when a glacial period was approaching, but
before an ice sheet had accumulated to any great extent,
a crescent-shaped strip from Montana through Illinois to
Maine would suffer a diminution in storminess ranging
up to 60 per cent as compared with inter-glacial conditions.
This is in strong contrast with an increase in
storminess amounting to 75 or even 100 per cent both in
the boreal storm belt in Canada and in the subtropical
belt in the Southwest. Such a decrease in storminess in
the central United States would apparently be most
noticeable in summer, as is shown in <em>Earth and Sun</em>.
Hence it would have a maximum effect in producing
aridity. This would favor the formation of loess, but it is
In discussions of climate, as of most subjects, a
peculiar psychological phenomenon is observable.
Everyone sees the necessity of explaining conditions
different from those that now exist, but few realize that
present conditions may be abnormal, and that they need
explanation just as much as do others. Because of this
tendency glaciation has been discussed with the greatest
fullness, while there has been much neglect not only of
the periods when the climate of the earth resembled that
of the present, but also of the vastly longer periods when
it was even milder than now.
doubtful whether the aridity would become extreme
<!--File: cc188.png Page 164-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_164" title="pg 164"></a>
enough to explain such vast deposits as are found
throughout large parts of the Mississippi Basin. That
would demand that hundreds of thousands of square miles
should become almost absolute desert, and it is not probable
that any such thing occurred. Nevertheless, according
to the cyclonic hypothesis the period immediately
before the advent of the ice would be relatively dry in
the central United States, and to that extent favorable to
the work of the wind.</p>

<p>As the climatic conditions became more severe and the
ice sheet expanded, the dryness and lack of storms would
apparently diminish. The reason, as has been explained,
would be the gradual pushing of the storms southward
by the high-pressure area which would develop over the
ice sheet. Thus at the height of a glacial epoch there
would apparently be great storminess in the area where
the loess is found, especially in summer. Hence the
cyclonic hypothesis does not accord with the idea of great
deposition of loess at the time of maximum glaciation.</p>

<p>Finally we come to the time when the ice was retreating.
We have already seen that not only the river flood
plains, but also vast areas of fresh glacial deposits would
be exposed to the winds, and would remain without vegetation
for a long time. At that very time the retreat of
the ice sheet would tend to permit the storms to follow
paths determined by the degree of solar activity, in place
of the far southerly paths to which the high atmospheric
pressure over the expanded ice sheet had previously
forced them. In other words, the conditions shown in
Fig. 2 would tend to reappear when the sun's activity
was diminishing and the ice sheet was retreating, just as
they had appeared when the sun was becoming more
active and the ice sheet was advancing. This time, however,
the semi-arid conditions arising from the scarcity
<!--File: cc189.png Page 165-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_165" title="pg 165"></a>
of storms would prevail in a region of glacial deposits
and widely spreading river deposits, few or none of
which would be covered with vegetation. The conditions
would be almost ideal for eolian erosion and for the
transportation of loess by the wind to areas a little more
remote from the ice where grassy vegetation had made a
start.</p>

<p>The cyclonic hypothesis also seems to offer a satisfactory
explanation of variations in the amount of loess
associated with the several glacial epochs. It attributes
these to differences in the rate of disappearance of the
ice, which in turn varied with the rate of decline of solar
activity and storminess. This is supposed to be the reason
why the Iowan loess deposits are much more extensive
than those of the other epochs, for the Iowan ice sheet
presumably accomplished part of its retreat much more
suddenly than the other ice sheets.<sup><a href="#fn59" id="r59">[59]</a></sup> The more sudden the
retreat, the greater the barren area where the winds
could gather fine bits of dust. Temporary readvances may
also have been so distributed and of such intensity that
they frequently accentuated the condition shown in Fig.
2, thus making the central United States dry soon after
the exposure of great amounts of glacial d&eacute;bris. The
closeness with which the cyclonic hypothesis accords with
the facts as to the loess is one of the pleasant surprises of
the hypothesis. The first draft of Fig. 2 and the first outlines
of the hypothesis were framed without thought of
the loess. Yet so far as can now be seen, both agree
closely with the conditions of loess formation.</p>

<h2>CAUSES OF MILD GEOLOGICAL CLIMATES</h2>


<p>In discussions of climate, as of most subjects, a
peculiar psychological phenomenon is observable.
Everyone sees the necessity of explaining conditions
different from those that now exist, but few realize that
present conditions may be abnormal, and that they need
explanation just as much as do others. Because of this
tendency glaciation has been discussed with the greatest
fullness, while there has been much neglect not only of
the periods when the climate of the earth resembled that
of the present, but also of the vastly longer periods when
it was even milder than now.</p>

<p>How important the periods of mild climate have been
in geological times may be judged from the relative
length of glacial compared with inter-glacial epochs, and
still more from the far greater relative length of the mild
parts of periods and eras when compared with the severe
parts. Recent estimates by R. T. Chamberlin<sup><a href="#fn60" id="r60">[60]</a></sup> indicate
that according to the consensus of opinion among geologists
the average inter-glacial epoch during the Pleistocene
was about five times as long as the average glacial
epoch, while the whole of a given glacial epoch averaged
five times as long as the period when the ice was at a
maximum. Climatic periods far milder, longer, and more
monotonous than any inter-glacial epoch appear repeatedly
<!--File: cc191.png Page 167-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_167" title="pg 167"></a>
during the course of geological history. Our task in
this chapter is to explain them.</p>

<p>Knowlton<sup><a href="#fn61" id="r61">[61]</a></sup> has done geology a great service by collecting
the evidence as to the mild type of climate which
has again and again prevailed in the past. He lays special
stress on botanical evidence since that pertains to the
variable atmosphere of the lands, and hence furnishes a
better guide than does the evidence of animals that lived
in the relatively unchanging water of the oceans. The
nature of the evidence has already been indicated in
various parts of this book. It includes palms, tree ferns,
and a host of other plants which once grew in regions
which are now much too cold to support them. With this
must be placed the abundant reef-building corals and
other warmth-loving marine creatures in latitudes now
much too cold for them. Of a piece with this are the conditions
of inter-glacial epochs in Europe, for example,
when elephants and hippopotamuses, as well as many
species of plants from low latitudes, were abundant.
These conditions indicate not only that the climate was
warmer than now, but that the contrast from season to
season was much less. Indeed, Knowlton goes so far as
to say that "relative uniformity, mildness, and comparative
equability of climate, accompanied by high humidity,
have prevailed over the greater part of the earth, extending
to, or into, polar circles, during the greater part of
geologic time&mdash;since, at least, the Middle Paleozoic. This
is the regular, the ordinary, the normal condition." ... "By
many it is thought that one of the strongest arguments
against a gradually cooling globe and a humid,
non-zonally disposed climate in the ages before the Pleistocene
is the discovery of evidences of glacial action
<!--File: cc192.png Page 168-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_168" title="pg 168"></a>
practically throughout the entire geologic column.
Hardly less than a dozen of these are now known, ranging
in age from Huronian to Eocene. It seems to be a very
general assumption by those who hold this view that
these evidences of glacial activities are to be classed as
ice ages, largely comparable in effect and extent to the
Pleistocene refrigeration, but as a matter of fact only
three are apparently of a magnitude to warrant such
designation. These are the Huronian glaciation, that of
the 'Permo-Carboniferous,' and that of the Pleistocene.
The others, so far as available data go, appear to be
explainable as more or less local manifestations that had
no widespread effect on, for instance, ocean temperatures,
distribution of life, et cetera. They might well have
been of the type of ordinary mountain glaciers, due entirely
to local elevation and precipitation." ... "If the
sun had been the principal source of heat in pre-Pleistocene
time, terrestrial temperatures would of necessity
have been disposed in zones, whereas the whole trend of
this paper has been the presentation of proof that these
temperatures were distinctly non-zonal. Therefore it
seems to follow that the sun&mdash;at least the present small-angle
sun&mdash;could not have been the sole or even the principal
source of heat that warmed the early oceans."</p>

<p>Knowlton is so strongly impressed by the widespread
fossil floras that usually occur in the middle parts of the
geological periods, that as Schuchert<sup><a href="#fn62">[62]</a></sup> puts it, he neglects
the evidence of other kinds. In the middle of the periods
and eras the expansion of the warm oceans over the continents
was greatest, while the lands were small and
hence had more or less insular climates of the oceanic
type. At such times, the marine fauna agrees with the
<!--File: cc193.png Page 169-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_169" title="pg 169"></a>
flora in indicating a mild climate. Large colony-forming
foraminifera, stony corals, shelled cephalopods, gastropods
and thick-shelled bivalves, generally the cemented
forms, were common in the Far North and even in the
Arctic. This occurred in the Silurian, Devonian, Pennsylvanian,
and Jurassic periods, yet at other times, such
as the Cretaceous and Eocene, such forms were very
greatly reduced in variety in the northern regions or else
wholly absent. These things, as Schuchert<sup><a href="#fn62" id="r62">[62]</a></sup> says, can only
mean that Knowlton is right when he states that "climatic
zoning such as we have had since the beginning of
the Pleistocene did not obtain in the geologic ages prior
to the Pleistocene." It does not mean, however, that
there was a "non-zonal arrangement" and that the temperature
of the oceans was everywhere the same and
"without widespread effect on the distribution of life."</p>

<p>Students of paleontology hold that as far back as we
can go in the study of plants, there are evidences of seasons
and of relatively cool climates in high latitudes. The
cycads, for instance, are one of the types most often used
as evidence of a warm climate. Yet Wieland,<sup><a href="#fn63" id="r63">[63]</a></sup> who has
made a lifelong study of these plants, says that many of
them "might well grow in temperate to cool climates.
Until far more is learned about them they should at least
be held as valueless as indices of tropic climates." The
inference is "that either they or their close relatives had
the capacity to live in every clime. There is also a suspicion
that study of the associated ferns may compel revision
of the long-accepted view of the universality of
tropic climates throughout the Mesozoic." Nathorst is
quoted by Wieland as saying, "I think ... that during
the time when the Gingkophytes and Cycadophytes dominated,
<!--File: cc194.png Page 170-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_170" title="pg 170"></a>
many of them must have adapted themselves for
living in cold climates also. Of this I have not the least
doubt."</p>

<p>Another important line of evidence which Knowlton
and others have cited as a proof of the non-zonal arrangement
of climate in the past, is the vast red beds which are
found in the Proterozoic, late Silurian, Devonian, Permian,
and Triassic, and in some Tertiary formations.
These are believed to resemble laterite, a red and highly
oxidized soil which is found in great abundance in equatorial
regions. Knowlton does not attempt to show that
the red beds present equatorial characteristics in other
respects, but bases his conclusion on the statement that
"red beds are not being formed at the present time in
any desert region." This is certainly an error. As has
already been said, in both the Transcaspian and Takla
Makan deserts, the color of the sand regularly changes
from brown on the borders to pale red far out in the
desert. Kuzzil Kum, or Red Sand, is the native name.
The sands in the center of the desert apparently were
originally washed down from the same mountains as
those on the borders, and time has turned them red.
Since the same condition is reported from the Arabian
Desert, it seems that redness is characteristic of some of
the world's greatest deserts. Moreover, beds of salt and
gypsum are regularly found in red beds, and they can
scarcely originate except in deserts, or in shallow almost
landlocked bays on the coasts of deserts, as appears to
have happened in the Silurian where marine fossils are
found interbedded with gypsum.</p>

<p>Again, Knowlton says that red beds cannot indicate
deserts because the plants found in them are not
"pinched or depauperate, nor do they indicate xerophytic
adaptations. Moreover, very considerable deposits
<!--File: cc195.png Page 171-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_171" title="pg 171"></a>
of coal are found in red beds in many parts of the world,
which implies the presence of swamps but little above
sea-level."</p>

<p>Students of desert botany are likely to doubt the force
of these considerations. As MacDougal<sup><a href="#fn64" id="r64">[64]</a></sup> has shown, the
variety of plants in deserts is greater than in moist
regions. Not only do xerophytic desert species prevail,
but halophytes are present in the salty areas, and hygrophytes
in the wet swampy areas, while ordinary mesophytes
prevail along the water courses and are washed
down from the mountains. The ordinary plants, not the
xerophytes, are the ones that are chiefly preserved since
they occur in most abundance near streams where deposition
is taking place. So far as swamps are concerned, few
are of larger size than those of Seistan in Persia, Lop
Nor in Chinese Turkestan, and certain others in the midst
of the Asiatic deserts. Streams flowing from the mountains
into deserts are almost sure to form large swamps,
such as those along the Tarim River in central Asia.
Lake Chad in Africa is another example. In it, too, reeds
are very numerous.</p>

<p>Putting together the evidence on both sides in this disputed
question, it appears that throughout most of geological
time there is some evidence of a zonal arrangement
of climate. The evidence takes the form of traces of
cool climates, of seasons, and of deserts. Nevertheless,
there is also strong evidence that these conditions were
in general less intense than at present and that times of
relatively warm, moist climate without great seasonal
extremes have prevailed very widely during periods
much longer than those when a zonal arrangement as
<!--File: cc196.png Page 172-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_172" title="pg 172"></a>
marked as that of today prevailed. As Schuchert<sup><a href="#fn65" id="r65">[65]</a></sup> puts it:
"Today the variation on land between the tropics and the
poles is roughly between 110&deg; and -60&deg;F., in the oceans
between 85&deg; and 31&deg;F. In the geologic past the temperature
of the oceans for the greater parts of the periods
probably was most often between 85&deg; and 55&deg;F., while on
land it may have varied between 90&deg; and 0&deg;F. At rare
intervals the extremes were undoubtedly as great as they
are today. The conclusion is therefore that at all times
the earth had temperature zones, varying between the
present-day intensity and times which were almost without
such belts, and at these latter times the greater part
of the earth had an almost uniformly mild climate, without
winters."</p>

<p>It is these mild climates which we must now attempt
to explain. This leads us to inquire what would happen to
the climate of the earth as a whole if the conditions which
now prevail at times of few sunspots were to become
intensified. That they could become greatly intensified
seems highly probable, for there is good reason to think
that aside from the sunspot cycle the sun's atmosphere
is in a disturbed condition. The prominences which
sometimes shoot out hundreds of thousands of miles
seem to be good evidence of this. Suppose that the sun's
atmosphere should become very quiet. This would apparently
mean that cyclonic storms would be much less
numerous and less severe than during the present times
of sunspot minima. The storms would also apparently
follow paths in middle latitudes somewhat as they do
now when sunspots are fewest. The first effect of such a
condition, if we can judge from what happens at present,
would be a rise in the general temperature of the earth,
because less heat would be carried aloft by storms.</p>
<!--File: cc197.png Page 173-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_173" title="pg 173"></a>
<p>Today, as is shown in <em>Earth and Sun</em>, a difference of
perhaps 10 per cent in the average storminess during
periods of sunspot maxima and minima is correlated with
a difference of 3&deg;C. in the temperature at the earth's
surface. This includes not only an actual lowering of
0.6&deg;C. at times of sunspot maxima, but the overcoming
of the effect of increased insolation at such times, an
effect which Abbot calculates as about 2.5&deg;C. If the
storminess were to be reduced to one-half or one-quarter
its present amount at sunspot minima, not only would the
loss of heat by upward convection in storms be diminished,
but the area covered by clouds would diminish so
that the sun would have more chance to warm the lower
air. Hence the average rise of temperature might amount
to as much at 5&deg; or 10&deg;C.</p>

<p>Another effect of the decrease in storminess would be
to make the so-called westerly winds, which are chiefly
southwesterly in the northern hemisphere and northwesterly
in the southern hemisphere, more strong and
steady than at present. They would not continually suffer
interruption by cyclonic winds from other directions, as
is now the case, and would have a regularity like that
of the trades. This conclusion is strongly re&euml;nforced in
a paper by Clayton<sup><a href="#fn66" id="r66">[66]</a></sup> which came to hand after this chapter
had been completed. From his studies of the solar
constant and the temperature of the earth which are
described in <em>Earth and Sun</em>, he reaches the following
conclusion: "The results of these researches have led
me to believe: 1. That if there were no variation in solar
radiation the atmospheric motions would establish a
stable system with exchanges of air between equator and
pole and between ocean and land, in which the only variations
<!--File: cc198.png Page 174-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_174" title="pg 174"></a>
would be daily and annual changes set in operation
by the relative motions of the earth and sun. 2. The existing
abnormal changes, which we call weather, have their
origins chiefly, if not entirely, in the variations of solar
radiation."</p>

<p>If cyclonic storms and "weather" were largely eliminated
and if the planetary system of winds with its
steady trades and southwesterlies became everywhere
dominant, the regularity and volume of the poleward-flowing
currents, such as the Gulf Stream and the
Atlantic Drift in one ocean, and the Japanese Current in
another, would be greatly increased. How important this
is may be judged from the work of Helland-Hansen and
Nansen.<sup><a href="#fn67" id="r67">[67]</a></sup> These authors find that with the passage of each
cyclonic storm there is a change in the temperature of
the surface water of the Atlantic Ocean. Winds at right
angles to the course of the Drift drive the water first in
one direction and then in the other but do not advance it
in its course. Winds with an easterly component, on the
other hand, not only check the Drift but reverse it, driving
the warm water back toward the southwest and
allowing cold water to well up in its stead. The driving
force in the Atlantic Drift is merely the excess of the
winds with a westerly component over those with an
easterly component.</p>

<p>Suppose that the numbers in Fig. 8 represent the
strength of the winds in a certain part of the North
Atlantic or North Pacific, that is, the total number of
miles moved by the air per year. In quadrant A of the
left-hand part all the winds move from a more or less
southwesterly direction and produce a total movement
<!--File: cc199.png Page 175-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_175" title="pg 175"></a>
of the air amounting to thirty units per year. Those
coming from points between north and west move twenty-five
units; those between north and east, twenty units;
and those between east and south, twenty-five units.
Since the movement of the winds in quadrants B and
D is the same, these winds have no effect in producing
currents. They merely move the water back and forth,
and thus give it time to lose whatever heat it has brought
from more southerly latitudes. On the other hand, since
the easterly winds in quadrant C do not wholly check the
currents caused by the westerly winds of quadrant A,
the effective force of the westerly winds amounts to ten,
or the difference between a force of thirty in quadrant A
and of twenty in quadrant C. Hence the water is moved
forward toward the northeast, as shown by the thick
part of arrow A.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Fig. 8. Effect of diminution of storms on
movement of water.</em></p>

<p>Now suppose that cyclonic storms should be greatly
reduced in number so that in the zone of prevailing
westerlies they were scarcely more numerous than tropical
<!--File: cc200.png Page 176-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_176" title="pg 176"></a>
hurricanes now are in the trade-wind belt. Then the
more or less southwesterly winds in quadrant A&acute; in the
right-hand part of Fig. 8 would not only become more
frequent but would be stronger than at present. The
total movement from that quarter might rise to sixty
units, as indicated in the figure. In quadrants B&acute; and D&acute;
the movement would fall to fifteen and in quadrant C&acute; to
ten. B&acute; and D&acute; would balance one another as before. The
movement in A&acute;, however, would exceed that in C&acute; by fifty
instead of ten. In other words, the current-making force
would become five times as great as now. The actual
effect would be increased still more, for the winds from
the southwest would be stronger as well as steadier if
there were no storms. A strong wind which causes whitecaps
has much more power to drive the water forward
than a weaker wind which does not cause whitecaps. In a
wave without a whitecap the water returns to practically
the original point after completing a circle beneath the
surface. In a wave with a whitecap, however, the cap
moves forward. Any increase in velocity beyond the rate
at which whitecaps are formed has a great influence upon
the amount of water which is blown forward. Several
times as much water is drifted forward by a persistent
wind of twenty miles an hour as by a ten-mile wind.<sup><a href="#fn68" id="r68">[68]</a></sup></p>

<p>In this connection a suggestion which is elaborated in
Chapter XIII may be mentioned. At present the salinity
of the oceans checks the general deep-sea circulation and
thereby increases the contrasts from zone to zone. In the
past, however, the ocean must have been fresher than
now. Hence the circulation was presumably less impeded,
and the transfer of heat from low latitudes to high was
facilitated.</p>

<!--File: cc201.png Page 177-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_177" title="pg 177"></a>


<p>Consider now the magnitude of the probable effect of
a diminution in storms. Today off the coast of Norway
in latitude 65&deg;N. and longitude 10&deg;E., the mean temperature
in January is 2&deg;C. and in July 12&deg;C. This represents
a plus anomaly of about 22&deg; in January and 2&deg; in July;
that is, the Norwegian coast is warmer than the normal
for its latitude by these amounts. Suppose that in some
past time the present distribution of lands and seas prevailed,
but Norway was a lowland where extensive deposits
could accumulate in great flood plains. Suppose,
also, that the sun's atmosphere was so inactive that few
cyclonic storms occurred, steady winds from the west-southwest
prevailed, and strong, uninterrupted ocean
currents brought from the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of
Mexico much greater supplies of warm water than at
present. The Norwegian winters would then be warmer
than now not only because of the general increase in temperature
which the earth regularly experiences at sunspot
minima, but because the currents would accentuate
this condition. In summer similar conditions would prevail
except that the warming effect of the winds and
currents would presumably be less than in winter, but
this might be more than balanced by the increased heat
of the sun during the long summer days, for storms and
clouds would be rare.</p>

<p>If such conditions raised the winter temperature only
8&deg;C. and the summer temperature 4&deg;C., the climate would
be as warm as that of the northern island of New Zealand
(latitude 35&deg;-43&deg;S.). The flora of that part of New Zealand
is subtropical and includes not only pines and
beeches, but palms and tree ferns. A climate scarcely
warmer than that of New Zealand would foster a flora
like that which existed in far northern latitudes during
some of the milder geological periods. If, however, the
<!--File: cc202.png Page 178-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_178" title="pg 178"></a>
general temperature of the earth's surface were raised
5&deg; because of the scarcity of storms, if the currents were
strong enough so that they increased the present anomaly
by 50 per cent, and if more persistent sunshine in summer
raised the temperature at that season about 4&deg;C., the
January temperature would be 18&deg;C. and the July temperature
22&deg;C. These figures perhaps make summer and
winter more nearly alike than was ever really the case in
such latitudes. Nevertheless, they show that a diminution
of storms and a consequent strengthening and steadying
of the southwesterlies might easily raise the temperature
of the Norwegian coast so high that corals could flourish
within the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>Another factor would co&ouml;perate in producing mild
temperatures in high latitudes during the winter, namely,
the fogs which would presumably accumulate. It is well
known that when saturated air from a warm ocean is
blown over the lands in winter, as happens so often in the
British Islands and around the North Sea, fog is formed.
The effect of such a fog is indeed to shut out the sun's
radiation, but in high latitudes during the winter when
the sun is low, this is of little importance. Another effect
is to retain the heat of the earth itself. When a constant
supply of warm water is being brought from low latitudes
this blanketing of the heat by the fog becomes of
great importance. In the past, whenever cyclonic storms
were weak and westerly winds were correspondingly
strong, winter fogs in high latitudes must have been much
more widespread and persistent than now.</p>

<p>The bearing of fogs on vegetation is another interesting
point. If a region in high latitudes is constantly protected
by fog in winter, it can support types of vegetation
characteristic of fairly low latitudes, for plants are
oftener killed by dry cold than by moist cold. Indeed,
<!--File: cc203.png Page 179-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_179" title="pg 179"></a>
excessive evaporation from the plant induced by dry
cold when the evaporated water cannot be rapidly replaced
by the movement of sap is a chief reason why
large plants are winterkilled. The growing of transplanted
palms on the coast of southwestern Ireland, in
spite of its location in latitude 50&deg;N., is possible only because
of the great fogginess in winter due to the marine
climate. The fogs prevent the escape of heat and ward off
killing frosts. The tree ferns in latitude 46&deg;S. in New
Zealand, already referred to, are often similarly protected
in winter. Therefore, the relative frequency of fogs
in high latitudes when storms were at a minimum would
apparently tend not merely to produce mild winters but
to promote tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>The strong steady trades and southwesterlies which
would prevail at times of slight solar activity, according
to our hypothesis, would have a pronounced effect on the
water of the deep seas as well as upon that of the surface.
In the first place, the deep-sea circulation would be hastened.
For convenience let us speak of the northern hemisphere.
In the past, whenever the southwesterly winds
were steadier than now, as was probably the case when
cyclonic storms were relatively rare, more surface water
than at present was presumably driven from low latitudes
and carried to high latitudes. This, of course, means that
a greater volume of water had to flow back toward the
equator in the lower parts of the ocean, or else as a cool
surface current. The steady southwesterly winds, however,
would interfere with south-flowing surface currents,
thus compelling the polar waters to find their way
equatorward beneath the surface. In low latitudes the
polar waters would rise and their tendency would be to
lower the temperature. Hence steadier westerlies would
make for lessened latitudinal contrasts in climate not
<!--File: cc204.png Page 180-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_180" title="pg 180"></a>
only by driving more warm water poleward but by causing
more polar water to reach low latitudes.</p>

<p>At this point a second important consideration must be
faced. Not only would the deep-sea circulation be hastened,
but the ocean depths might be warmed. The deep
parts of the ocean are today cold because they receive
their water from high latitudes where it sinks because of
low temperature. Suppose, however, that a diminution in
storminess combined with other conditions should permit
corals to grow in latitude 70&deg;N. The ocean temperature
would then have to average scarcely lower than 20&deg;C.
and even in the coldest month the water could scarcely
fall below about 15&deg;C. Under such conditions, if the polar
ocean were freely connected with the rest of the oceans,
no part of it would probably have a temperature much
below 10&deg;C., for there would be no such thing as ice caps
and snowfields to reflect the scanty sunlight and radiate
into space what little heat there was. On the contrary,
during the winter an almost constant state of dense fogginess
would prevail. So great would be the blanketing
effect of this that a minimum monthly temperature of
10&deg;C. for the coldest part of the ocean may perhaps be
too low for a time when corals thrived in latitude 70&deg;.</p>

<p>The temperature of the ocean depths cannot permanently
remain lower than that of the coldest parts of the
surface. Temporarily this might indeed happen when a
solar change first reduced the storminess and strengthened
the westerlies and the surface currents. Gradually,
however, the persistent deep-sea circulation would bring
up the colder water in low latitudes and carry downward
the water of medium temperature at the coldest part of
the surface. Thus in time the whole body of the ocean
would become warm. The heat which at present is carried
away from the earth's surface in storms would slowly
<!--File: cc205.png Page 181-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_181" title="pg 181"></a>
accumulate in the oceans. As the process went on, all
parts of the ocean's surface would become warmer, for
equatorial latitudes would be less and less cooled by cold
water from below, while the water blown from low latitudes
to high would be correspondingly warmer. The
warming of the ocean would come to an end only with
the attainment of a state of equilibrium in which the loss
of heat by radiation and evaporation from the ocean's
surface equaled the loss which under other circumstances
would arise from the rise of warm air in cyclonic storms.
When once the oceans were warmed, they would form an
extremely strong conservative force tending to preserve
an equable climate in all latitudes and at all seasons.
According to the solar cyclonic hypothesis such conditions
ought to have prevailed throughout most of geological
time. Only after a strong and prolonged solar
disturbance with its consequent storminess would conditions
like those of today be expected.</p>

<p>In this connection another possibility may be mentioned.
It is commonly assumed that the earth's axis is
held steadily in one direction by the fact that the rotating
earth is a great gyroscope. Having been tilted to a certain
position, perhaps by some extraneous force, the axis
is supposed to maintain that position until some other
force intervenes. Cordeiro,<sup><a href="#fn69" id="r69">[69]</a></sup> however, maintains that this
is true only of an absolutely rigid gyroscope. He believes
that it is mathematically demonstrable that if an elastic
gyroscope be gradually tilted by some extraneous force,
and if that force then ceases to act, the gyroscope as a
whole will oscillate back and forth. The earth appears to
be slightly elastic. Cordeiro therefore applies his formul&aelig;
to it, on the following assumptions: (1) That the
original position of the axis was nearly vertical to the
<!--File: cc206.png Page 182-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_182" title="pg 182"></a>
plane of the ecliptic in which the earth revolves around
the sun; (2) that at certain times the inclination has been
even greater than now; and (3) that the position of the
axis with reference to the earth has not changed to any
great extent, that is, the earth's poles have remained
essentially stationary with reference to the earth, although
the whole earth has been gyroscopically tilted
back and forth repeatedly.</p>

<p>With a vertical axis the daylight and darkness in all
parts of the earth would be of equal duration, being
always twelve hours. There would be no seasons, and the
climate would approach the average condition now experienced
at the two equinoxes. On the whole the climate
of high latitudes would give the impression of being
milder than now, for there would be less opportunity for
the accumulation of snow and ice with their strong cooling
effect. On the other hand, if the axis were tilted more
than now, the winter nights would be longer and the
winters more severe than at present, and there would be
a tendency toward glaciation. Thus Cordeiro accounts
for alternating mild and glacial epochs. The entire swing
from the vertical position to the maximum inclination
and back to the vertical may last millions of years depending
on the earth's degree of elasticity. The swing
beyond the vertical position in the other direction would
be equally prolonged. Since the axis is now supposed to
be much nearer its maximum than its minimum degree of
tilting, the duration of epochs having a climate more
severe than that of the present would be relatively short,
while the mild epochs would be long.</p>

<p>Cordeiro's hypothesis has been almost completely
ignored. One reason is that his treatment of geological
facts, and especially his method of riding rough-shod
over widely accepted conclusions, has not commended his
<!--File: cc207.png Page 183-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_183" title="pg 183"></a>
work to geologists. Therefore they have not deemed it
worth while to urge mathematicians to test the assumptions
and methods by which he reached his results. It is
perhaps unfair to test Cordeiro by geology, for he lays
no claim to being a geologist. In mathematics he labors
under the disadvantage of having worked outside the
usual professional channels, so that his work does not
seem to have been subjected to sufficiently critical
analysis.</p>

<p>Without expressing any opinion as to the value of
Cordeiro's results we feel that the subject of the earth's
gyroscopic motion and of a possible secular change in
the direction of the axis deserves investigation for two
chief reasons. In the first place, evidences of seasonal
changes and of seasonal uniformity seem to occur more
or less alternately in the geological record. Second, the
remarkable discoveries of Garner and Allard<sup><a href="#fn70" id="r70">[70]</a></sup> show that
the duration of daylight has a pronounced effect upon
the reproduction of plants. We have referred repeatedly
to the tree ferns, corals, and other forms of life which
now live in relatively low latitudes and which cannot
endure strong seasonal contrasts, but which once lived
far to the north. On the other hand, Sayles,<sup><a href="#fn71" id="r71">[71]</a></sup> for example,
finds that microscopical examination of the banding of
ancient shales and slates indicates distinct seasonal banding
like that of recent Pleistocene clays or of the Squantum
slate formed during or near the Permian glacial
period. Such seasonal banding is found in rocks of various
ages: (a) Huronian, in cobalt shales previously
reported by Coleman; (b) late Proterozoic or early Cambrian,
<!--File: cc208.png Page 184-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_184" title="pg 184"></a>
in Hiwassee slate; (c) lower Cambrian, in Georgian
slates of Vermont; (d) lower Ordovician, in Georgia
(Rockmart slate), Tennessee (Athens shale), Vermont
(slates), and Quebec (Beekmantown formation); and (e)
Permian in Massachusetts (Squantum slate). How far
the periods during which such evidence of seasons was
recorded really alternated with mild periods, when tropical
species lived in high latitudes and the contrast of
seasons was almost or wholly lacking, we have as yet no
means of knowing. If periods characterized by marked
seasonal changes should be found to have alternated with
those when the seasons were of little importance, the fact
would be of great geological significance.</p>

<p>The discoveries of Garner and Allard as to the effect
of light on reproduction began with a peculiar tobacco
plant which appeared in some experiments at Washington.
The plant grew to unusual size, and seemed to
promise a valuable new variety. It formed no seeds, however,
before the approach of cold weather. It was therefore
removed to a greenhouse where it flowered and
produced seed. In succeeding years the flowering was
likewise delayed till early winter, but finally it was discovered
that if small plants were started in the greenhouse
in the early fall they flowered at the same time as
the large ones. Experiments soon demonstrated that the
time of flowering depends largely upon the length of the
daily period when the plants are exposed to light. The
same is true of many other plants, and there is great
variety in the conditions which lead to flowering. Some
plants, such as witch hazel, appear to be stimulated to
bloom by very short days, while others, such as evening
primrose, appear to require relatively long days. So
sensitive are plants in this respect that Garner and
Allard, by changing the length of the period of light, have
<!--File: cc209.png Page 185-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_185" title="pg 185"></a>
caused a flowerbud in its early stages not only to stop
developing but to return once more to a vegetative shoot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Common iris, which flowers in May and June, will not blossom
under ordinary conditions when grown in the greenhouse in
winter, even under the same temperature conditions that prevail
in early summer. Again, one variety of soy beans will regularly
begin to flower in June of each year, a second variety in July,
and a third in August, when all are planted on the same date.
There are no temperature differences during the summer months
which could explain these differences in time of flowering; and,
since "internal causes" alone cannot be accepted as furnishing
a satisfactory explanation, some external factor other than temperature
must be responsible.</p>

<p>The ordinary varieties of cosmos regularly flower in the fall
in northern latitudes if they are planted in the spring or summer.
If grown in a warm greenhouse during the winter months the
plants also flower readily, so that the cooler weather of fall is
not a necessary condition. If successive plantings of cosmos are
made in the greenhouse during the late winter and early spring
months, maintaining a uniform temperature throughout, the
plantings made after a certain date will fail to blossom promptly,
but, on the contrary, will continue to grow till the following fall,
thus flowering at the usual season for this species. This curious
reversal of behavior with advance of the season cannot be attributed
to change in temperature. Some other factor is responsible
for the failure of cosmos to blossom during the summer months.
In this respect the behavior of cosmos is just the opposite of that
observed in iris.</p>

<p>Certain varieties of soy beans change their behavior in a
peculiar manner with advance of the summer season. The variety
known as Biloxi, for example, when planted early in the spring
in the latitude of Washington, D. C., continues to grow throughout
the summer, flowering in September. The plants maintain
growth without flowering for fifteen to eighteen weeks, attaining
a height of five feet or more. As the dates of successive plantings
are moved forward through the months of June and July, however,
<!--File: cc210.png Page 186-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_186" title="pg 186"></a>
there is a marked tendency for the plants to cut short the
period of growth which precedes flowering. This means, of course,
that there is a tendency to flower at approximately the same time
of year regardless of the date of planting. As a necessary consequence,
the size of the plants at the time of flowering is reduced
in proportion to the delay in planting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bearing of this on geological problems lies in a
query which it raises as to the ability of a genus or family
of plants to adapt itself to days of very different length
from those to which it is wonted. Could tree ferns, ginkgos,
cycads, and other plants whose usual range of location
never subjects them to daylight for more than
perhaps fourteen hours or less than ten, thrive and reproduce
themselves if subjected to periods of daylight
ranging all the way from nothing up to about twenty-four
hours? No answer to this is yet possible, but the
question raises most interesting opportunities of investigation.
If Cordeiro is right as to the earth's elastic
gyroscopic motion, there may have been certain periods
when a vertical or almost vertical axis permitted the
days to be of almost equal length at all seasons in all
latitudes. If such an absence of seasons occurred when
the lands were low, when the oceans were extensive and
widely open toward the poles, and when storms were
relatively inactive, the result might be great mildness of
climate such as appears sometimes to have prevailed in
the middle of geological eras. Suppose on the other hand
that the axis should be tilted more than now, and that
the lands should be widely emergent and the storm belt
highly active in low latitudes, perhaps because of the
activity of the sun. The conditions might be favorable for
glaciation at latitudes as low as those where the Permo-Carboniferous
ice sheets appear to have centered. The
possibilities thus suggested by Cordeiro's hypothesis are
<!--File: cc211.png Page 187-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_187" title="pg 187"></a>
so interesting that the gyroscopic motion of the earth
ought to be investigated more thoroughly. Even if no
such gyroscopic motion takes place, however, the other
causes of mild climate discussed in this chapter may
be enough to explain all the observed phenomena.</p>

<p>Many important biological consequences might be
drawn from this study of mild geological climates, but
this book is not the place for them. In the first chapter
we saw that one of the most remarkable features of the
climate of the earth is its wonderful uniformity through
hundreds of millions of years. As we come down through
the vista of years the mild geological periods appear to
represent a return as nearly as possible to this standard
condition of uniformity. Certain changes of the earth
itself, as we shall see in the next chapter, may in the long
run tend slightly to change the exact conditions of this
climatic standard, as we might perhaps call it. Yet they
act so slowly that their effect during hundreds of millions
of years is still open to question. At most they seem
merely to have produced a slight increase in diversity
from season to season and from zone to zone. The normal
climate appears still to be of a milder type than that
which happens to prevail at present. Some solar condition,
whose possible nature will be discussed later, seems
even now to cause the number of cyclonic storms to be
greater than normal. Hence the earth's climate still
shows something of the great diversity of seasons and
of zones which is so marked a characteristic of glacial
epochs.</p>

<h2 id="Chapt_XI"><a href="#content">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3>TERRESTRIAL CAUSES OF CLIMATIC CHANGES</h3>


<p>The major portion of this book has been concerned
with the explanation of the more abrupt and extreme
changes of climate. This chapter and the
next consider two other sorts of climatic changes, the
slight secular progression during the hundreds of millions
of years of recorded earth history, and especially
the long slow geologic oscillations of millions or tens of
millions of years. It is generally agreed among geologists
that the progressive change has tended toward greater
extremes of climate; that is, greater seasonal contrasts,
and greater contrasts from place to place and from zone
to zone.<sup><a href="#fn72" id="r72">[72]</a></sup> The slow cyclic changes have been those that
favored widespread glaciation at one extreme near the
ends of geologic periods and eras, and mild temperatures
even in subpolar regions at the other extreme during the
medial portions of the periods.</p>

<p>As has been pointed out in an earlier chapter, it has
often been assumed that all climatic changes are due to
terrestrial causes. We have seen, however, that there is
strong evidence that solar variations play a large part in
modifying the earth's climate. We have also seen that no
known terrestrial agency appears to be able to produce
the abrupt changes noted in recent years, the longer
<!--File: cc213.png Page 189-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_189" title="pg 189"></a>
cycles of historical times, or geological changes of the
shorter type, such as glaciation. Nevertheless, terrestrial
changes doubtless have assisted in producing both the
progressive change and the slow cyclic changes recorded
in the rocks, and it is the purpose of this chapter and the
two that follow to consider what terrestrial changes have
taken place and the probable effect of such changes.</p>

<p>The terrestrial changes that have a climatic significance
are numerous. Some, such as variations in the
amount of volcanic dust in the higher air, have been considered
in an earlier chapter. Others are too imperfectly
known to warrant discussion, and in addition there are
presumably others which are entirely unknown. Doubtless
some of these little known or unknown changes have
been of importance in modifying climate. For example,
the climatic influence of vegetation, animals, and man
may be appreciable. Here, however, we shall confine ourselves
to purely physical causes, which will be treated in
the following order: First, those concerned with the solid
parts of the earth, namely: (I) amount of land; (II) distribution
of land; (III) height of land; (IV) lava flows;
and (V) internal heat. Second, those which arise from
the salinity of oceans, and third, those depending on the
composition and amount of atmosphere.</p>

<p>The terrestrial change which appears indirectly to
have caused the greatest change in climate is the contraction
of the earth. The problem of contraction is
highly complex and is as yet only imperfectly understood.
Since only its results and not its processes influence climate,
the following section as far as page 196 is not
necessary to the general reader. It is inserted in order to
explain why we assume that there have been oscillations
between certain types of distribution of the lands.</p>

<p>The extent of the earth's contraction may be judged
<!--File: cc214.png Page 190-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_190" title="pg 190"></a>
from the shrinkage indicated by the shortening of the
rock formations in folded mountains such as the Alps,
Juras, Appalachians, and Caucasus. Geologists are continually
discovering new evidence of thrust faults of
great magnitude where masses of rock are thrust bodily
over other rocks, sometimes for many miles. Therefore,
the estimates of the amount of shrinkage based on the
measurements of folds and faults need constant revision
upward. Nevertheless, they have already reached a considerable
figure. For example, in 1919, Professor A. Heim
estimated the shortening of the meridian passing through
the modern Alps and the ancient Hercynian and Caledonian
mountains as fully a thousand miles in Europe,
and over five hundred miles for the rest of this meridian.<sup><a href="#fn73" id="r73">[73]</a></sup>
This is a radial shortening of about 250 miles. Possibly
the shrinkage has been even greater than this. Chamberlin<sup><a href="#fn74" id="r74">[74]</a></sup>
has compared the density of the earth, moon, Mars,
and Venus with one another, and found it probable that
the radial shrinkage of the earth may be as much as
570 miles. This result is not so different from Heim's as
appears at first sight, for Heim made no allowance for
unrecognized thrust faults and for the contraction incident
to metamorphism. Moreover, Heim did not include
shrinkage during the first half of geological time before
the above-mentioned mountain systems were upheaved.</p>

<p>According to a well-established law of physics, contraction
of a rotating body results in more rapid rotation
and greater centrifugal force. These conditions must increase
the earth's equatorial bulge and thereby cause
changes in the distribution of land and water. Opposed
to the rearrangement of the land due to increased rotation
<!--File: cc215.png Page 191-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_191" title="pg 191"></a>
caused by contraction, there has presumably been
another rearrangement due to tidal retardation of the
earth's rotation and a consequent lessening of the equatorial
bulge. G. H. Darwin long ago deduced a relatively
large retardation due to lunar tides. A few years ago
W. D. MacMillan, on other assumptions, deduced only a
negligible retardation. Still more recently Taylor<sup><a href="#fn75" id="r75">[75]</a></sup> has
studied the tides of the Irish Sea, and his work has led
Jeffreys<sup><a href="#fn76" id="r76">[76]</a></sup> and
Brown<sup><a href="#fn77" id="r77">[77]</a></sup> to conclude that there has been considerable
retardation, perhaps enough, according to
Brown, to equal the acceleration due to the earth's contraction.
From a prolonged and exhaustive study of the
motions of the moon Brown concludes that tidal friction
or some other cause is now lengthening the day at the rate
of one second per thousand years, or an hour in almost
four million years if the present rate continues. He makes
it clear that the retardation due to tides would not correspond
in point of time with the acceleration due to contraction.
The retardation would occur slowly, and would
take place chiefly during the long quiet periods of geologic
history, while the acceleration would occur rapidly
at times of diastrophic deformation. As a consequence,
the equatorial bulge would alternately be reduced at a
slow rate, and then somewhat suddenly augmented.</p>

<p>The less rigid any part of the earth is, the more quickly
it responds to the forces which lead to bulging or which
tend to lessen the bulge. Since water is more fluid than
land, the contraction of the earth and the tidal retardation
presumably tend alternately to increase and decrease
the amount of water near the equator more than the
<!--File: cc216.png Pag2 192-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_192" title="pg 192"></a>
amount of land. Thus, throughout geological history we
should look for cyclic changes in the relative area of the
lands within the tropics and similar changes of opposite
phase in higher latitudes. The extent of the change would
depend upon (a) the amount of alteration in the speed
of rotation, and (b) the extent of low land in low latitudes
and of shallow sea in high latitudes. According to
Slichter's tables, if the earth should rotate in twenty-three
hours instead of twenty-four, the great Amazon
lowland would be submerged by the inflow of oceanic
water, while wide areas in Hudson Bay, the North Sea,
and other northern regions, would become land because
the ocean water would flow away from them.<sup><a href="#fn78" id="r78">[78]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following the prompt equatorward movement of water
which would occur as the speed of rotation increased,
there must also be a gradual movement or creepage of the
solid rocks toward the equator, that is, a bulging of the
ocean floor and of the lands in low latitudes, with a consequent
emergence of the lands there and a relative
rise of sea level in higher latitudes. Tidal retardation
would have a similar effect. Suess<sup><a href="#fn79" id="r79">[79]</a></sup> has described widespread
elevated strand lines in the tropics which he interprets
as indicating a relatively sudden change in sea
level, though he does not suggest a cause of the change.
However, in speaking of recent geological times, Suess
reports that a movement more recent than the old
strands "was an accumulation of water toward the
equator, a diminution toward the poles, and (it appears)
as though this last movement were only one of the many
oscillations which succeed each other with the same tendency,
i.e., with a positive excess at the equator, a negative
<!--File: cc217.png Page 193-->

excess at the poles." (Vol. II, p. 551.) This creepage
of the rocks equatorward seemingly might favor the
growth of mountains in tropical and subtropical regions,
because it is highly improbable that the increase in the
bulge would go on in all longitudes with perfect uniformity.
Where it went on most rapidly mountains would
arise. That such irregularity of movement has actually
occurred is suggested not only by the fact that many
Cenozoic and older mountain ranges extend east and
west, but by the further fact that these include some of
our greatest ranges, many of which are in fairly low latitudes.
The Himalayas, the Javanese ranges, and the half-submerged
Caribbean chains are examples. Such mountains
suggest a thrust in a north and south direction
which is just what would happen if the solid mass of the
earth were creeping first equatorward and then poleward.</p>

<p>A fact which is in accord with the idea of a periodic
increase in the oceans in low latitudes because of renewed
bulging at the equator is the exposure in moderately
high latitudes of the greatest extent of ancient rocks.
This seems to mean that in low latitudes the frequent
deepening of the oceans has caused the old rocks to be
largely covered by sediments, while the old lands in
higher latitudes have been left more fully exposed to
erosion.</p>

<p>Another suggestion of such periodic equatorward movements
of the ocean water is found in the reported contrast
between the relative stability with which the northern part
of North America has remained slightly above sea level
except at times of widespread submergence, while the
southern parts have suffered repeated submergence alternating
with great emergence.<sup><a href="#fn80" id="r80">[80]</a></sup> Furthermore, although
<!--File: cc218.png Page 194-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_194" title="pg 194"></a>
the northern part of North America has been generally
exposed to erosion since the Proterozoic, it has supplied
much less sediment than have the more southern land
areas.<sup><a href="#fn81" id="r81">[81]</a></sup> This apparently means that much of Canada has
stood relatively low, while repeated and profound uplift
alternating with depression has occurred in subtropical
latitudes, apparently in adjustment to changes in the
earth's speed of rotation. The uplifts generally followed
the times of submergence due to equatorward movement
of the water, though the buckling of the crust which accompanies
shrinkage doubtless caused some of the submergence.
The evidence that northern North America
stood relatively low throughout much of geological time
depends not only on the fact that little sediment came to
the south from the north, but also on the fact that at
times of especially widespread epicontinental seas, the
submergence was initiated at the north.<sup><a href="#fn82" id="r82">[82]</a></sup> This is especially
true for Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, and Jurassic
times in North America. General submergence of this
kind is supposed to be due chiefly to the overflowing of
the ocean when its level is slowly raised by the deposition
of sediment derived from the erosion of what once were
continental highlands but later are peneplains. The fact
that such submergence began in high latitudes, however,
seems to need a further explanation. The bulging of the
rock sphere at the equator and the consequent displacement
of some of the water in low latitudes would furnish
such an explanation, as would also a decrease in the speed
of rotation induced by tidal retardation, if that retardation
were great enough and rapid enough to be geologically
effective.</p>
<!--File: cc219.png Page 195-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_195" title="pg 95"></a>

<p>The climatic effects of the earth's contraction, which
we shall shortly discuss, are greatly complicated by the
fact that contraction has taken place irregularly. Such
irregularity has occurred in spite of the fact that the
processes which cause contraction have probably gone
on quite steadily throughout geological history. These
processes include the chemical reorganization of the minerals
of the crust, a process which is illustrated by the
metamorphism of sedimentary rocks into crystalline
forms. The escape of gases through volcanic action or
otherwise has been another important process.</p>

<p>Although the processes which cause contraction probably
go on steadily, their effect, as Chamberlin<sup><a href="#fn83" id="r83">[83]</a></sup> and
others have pointed out, is probably delayed by inertia.
Thus the settling of the crust or its movement on a large
scale is delayed. Perhaps the delay continues until the
stresses become so great that of themselves they overcome
the inertia, or possibly some outside agency, whose
nature we shall consider later, re&euml;nforces the stresses and
gives the slight impulse which is enough to release them
and allow the earth's crust to settle into a new state of
equilibrium. When contraction proceeds actively, the
ocean segments, being largest and heaviest, are likely to
settle most, resulting in a deepening of the oceans and an
emergence of the lands. Following each considerable contraction
there would be an increase in the speed of rotation.
The repeated contractions with consequent growth
of the equatorial bulge would alternate with long quiet
periods during which tidal retardation would again decrease
the speed of rotation and hence lessen the bulge.
The result would be repeated changes of distribution of
land and water, with consequent changes in climate.</p>
<!--File: cc220.png0 Page 196-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_196" title="pg 196"></a>

<p>I. We shall now consider the climatic effect of the
repeated changes in the relative amounts of land and
water which appear to have resulted from the earth's
contraction and from changes in its speed of rotation.
During many geologic epochs a larger portion of the
earth was covered with water than at present. For example,
during at least twelve out of about twenty epochs,
North America has suffered extensive inundations,<sup><a href="#fn84" id="r84">[84]</a></sup> and
in general the extensive submergence of Europe, the
other area well known geologically, has coincided with
that of North America. At other times, the ocean has
been less extensive than now, as for example during the
recent glacial period, and probably during several of
the glacial periods of earlier date. Each of the numerous
changes in the relative extent of the lands must have
resulted in a modification of climate.<sup><a href="#fn85" id="r85">[85]</a></sup> This modification
would occur chiefly because water becomes warm far
more slowly than land, and cools off far more slowly.</p>

<p>An increase in the lands would cause changes in several
climatic conditions. (a) The range of temperature between
day and night and between summer and winter
would increase, for lands become warmer by day and in
summer than do oceans, and cooler at night and in
winter. The higher summer temperature when the lands
are widespread is due chiefly to the fact that the land, if
not snow-covered, absorbs more of the sun's radiant
energy than does the ocean, for its reflecting power is
low. The lower winter temperature when lands are widespread
occurs not only because they cool off rapidly but
<!--File: cc221.png Page 197-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_197" title="pg 197"></a>
because the reduced oceans cannot give them so much
heat. Moreover, the larger the land, the more generally
do the winds blow outward from it in winter and thus
prevent the ocean heat from being carried inland. So
long as the ocean is not frozen in high latitudes, it is
generally the chief source of heat in winter, for the nights
are several months long near the poles, and even when
the sun does shine its angle is so low that reflection from
the snow is very great. Furthermore, although on the
average there is more reflection from water than from
land, the opposite is true in high latitudes in winter
when the land is snow-covered while the ocean is relatively
dark and is roughened by the waves. Another
factor in causing large lands to have extremely low temperature
in winter is the fact that in proportion to their
size they are less protected by fog and cloud than are
smaller areas. The belt of cloud and fog which is usually
formed when the wind blows from the ocean to the relatively
cold land is restricted to the coastal zone. Thus the
larger the land, the smaller the fraction in which loss of
heat by radiation is reduced by clouds and fogs. Hence
an increase in the land area is accompanied by an increase
in the contrasts in temperature between land and
water.</p>

<p>(b) The contrasts in temperature thus produced must
cause similar contrasts in atmospheric pressure, and
hence stronger barometric gradients. (c) The strong
gradients would mean strong winds, flowing from land
to sea or from sea to land. (d) Local convection would
also be strengthened in harmony with the expansion of
the lands, for the more rapid heating of land than of
water favors active convection.</p>

<p>(e) As the extent of the ocean diminished, there would
normally be a decrease in the amount of water vapor for
<!--File: cc222.png Page 198-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_198" title="pg 198"></a>
three reasons: (1) Evaporation from the ocean is the
great source of water vapor. Other conditions being
equal, the smaller the ocean becomes, the less the evaporation.
(2) The amount of water vapor in the air diminishes
as convection increases, since upward convection
is a chief method by which condensation and precipitation
are produced, and water vapor removed from the
atmosphere. (3) Nocturnal cooling sufficient to produce
dew and frost is very much more common upon land than
upon the ocean. The formation of dew and frost diminishes
the amount of water vapor at least temporarily.
(f) Any diminution in water vapor produced in these
ways, or otherwise, is significant because water vapor is
the most essential part of the atmosphere so far as regulation
of temperature is concerned. It tends to keep the
days from becoming hot or the nights cold. Therefore
any decrease in water vapor would increase the diurnal
and seasonal range of temperature, making the climate
more extreme and severe. Thus a periodic increase in the
area of the continents would clearly make for periodic
increased climatic contrasts, with great extremes, a type
of climatic change which has recurred again and again.
Indeed, each great glaciation accompanied or followed
extensive emergence of the lands.<sup><a href="#fn86" id="r86">[86]</a></sup></p>

<p>Whether or not there has been a <em>progressive</em> increase
from era to era in the area of the lands is uncertain.
Good authorities disagree widely. There is no doubt,
however, that at present the lands are more extensive
than at most times in the past, though smaller, perhaps,
than at certain periods. The wide expanse of lands helps
explain the prominence of seasons at present as compared
with the past.</p>

<!--File: cc223.png Page 199-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_199" title="pg 199"></a>

<p>II. The contraction of the earth, as we have seen, has
produced great changes in the distribution as well as in
the extent of land and water. Large parts of the present
continents have been covered repeatedly by the sea, and
extensive areas now covered with water have been land.
In recent geological times, that is, during the Pliocene and
Pleistocene, much of the present continental shelf, the
zone less than 600 feet below sea level, was land. If the
whole shelf had been exposed, the lands would have been
greater than at present by an area larger than North
America. When the lands were most elevated, or a little
earlier, North America was probably connected with
Asia and almost with Europe. Asia in turn was apparently
connected with the larger East Indian islands. In
much earlier times land occupied regions where now the
ocean is fairly deep. Groups of islands, such as the East
Indies and Malaysia and perhaps the West Indies, were
united into widespreading land masses. Figs. 7 and 9,
illustrating the paleography of the Permian and the
Cretaceous periods, respectively, indicate a land distribution
radically different from that of today.</p>

<p>So far as appears from the scattered facts of geological
history, the changes in the distribution of land seem
to have been marked by the following characteristics: (1)
Accompanying the differentiation of continental and
oceanic segments of the earth's crust, the oceans have
become somewhat deeper, and their basins perhaps
larger, while the continents, on the average, have been
more elevated and less subject to submergence. Hence
there have been less radical departures from the present
distribution during the relatively recent Cenozoic era
than in the ancient Paleozoic because the submergence of
continental areas has become less general and less frequent.
For example, the last extensive epeiric or interior
<!--File: cc224.png Page 200-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_200" title="pg 200"></a>
sea in North America was in the Cretaceous, at least ten
million years ago, and according to Barrell perhaps fifty
million, while in Europe, according to de Lapparent,<sup><a href="#fn87" id="r87">[87]</a></sup> a
smaller share of the present continent has been submerged
since the Cretaceous than before. Indeed, as in
North America, the submergence has decreased on the
average since the Paleozoic era. (2) The changes in distribution
of land which have taken place during earth
history have been cyclic. Repeatedly, at the close of each
of the score or so of geologic periods, the continents
emerged more or less, while at the close of the groups of
periods known as eras, the lands were especially large
and emergent. After each emergence, a gradual encroachment
of the sea took place, and toward the close of several
of the earlier periods, the sea appears to have
covered a large fraction of the present land areas. (3) On
the whole, the amount of land in the middle and high latitudes
of the northern hemisphere appears to have increased
during geologic time. Such an increase does not
require a growth of the continents, however, in the
broader sense of the term, but merely that a smaller
fraction of the continent and its shelf should be submerged.
(4) In tropical latitudes, on the other hand, the
extent of the lands seems to have decreased, apparently
by the growth of the ocean basins. South America and
Africa are thought by many students to have been connected,
and Africa was united with India via Madagascar,
as is suggested in Fig. 9. The most radical cyclic
as well as the most radical progressive changes in land
distribution also seem to have taken place in tropical
regions.<sup><a href="#fn88" id="r88">[88]</a></sup>

<p>Although there is much evidence of periodic increase
<!--File: cc226.png Page 202-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_202" title="pg 202"></a>
of the sea in equatorial latitudes and of land in high latitudes,
it has remained for the zo&ouml;logist Metcalf to present
a very pretty bit of evidence that at certain times
submergence along the equator coincided with emergence
in high latitudes, and vice versa. Certain fresh water
frogs which carry the same internal parasite are confined
to two widely separated areas in tropical and south temperate
America and in Australia. The extreme improbability
that both the frogs and the parasites could have
originated independently in two unconnected areas and
could have developed by convergent evolution so that
they are almost identical in the two continents makes it
almost certain that there must have been a land connection
between South America and Australia, presumably
by way of Antarctica. The facts as to the parasites
seem also to prove that while the land connection existed
there was a sea across South America in equatorial latitudes.
The parasite infests not only the frogs but the
American toads known as Bufo. Now Bufo originated
north of the equator in America and differs from the
frogs which originated in southern South America in
not being found in Australia. This raises the question of
how the frogs could go to Australia via Antarctica carrying
the parasite with them, while the toads could not go.
Metcalf's answer is that the toads were cut off from the
southern part of South America by an equatorial sea
until after the Antarctic connection between the Old
World and the New was severed.</p>

<blockquote><p>
As Patagonia let go of Antarctica by subsidence of the intervening
land area, there was a probable concomitant rise of land
through what is now middle South America and the northern
and southern portions of this continent came together.<sup><a href="#fn89" id="r89">[89]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>


<!--File: cc227.png Page 203-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_203" title="pg 203"></a>

<p>These various changes in the earth's crust have given
rise to certain specific types of distribution of the lands,
which will now be considered. We shall inquire what climatic
conditions would arise from changes in (a) the
continuity of the lands from north to south, (b) the
amount of land in tropical latitudes, and (c) the amount
of land in middle and high latitudes.</p>

<p>(a) At present the westward drift of warm waters, set
in motion by the trade winds, is interrupted by land
masses and turned poleward, producing the important
Gulf Stream Drift and Japan Current in the northern
hemisphere, and corresponding, though less important,
currents in the southern hemisphere. During the past,
quite different sets of ocean currents doubtless have
existed in response to a different distribution of land.
Repeatedly, in the mid-Cretaceous (Fig. 9) and several
other periods, the present American barrier to the westward
moving tropical current was broken in Central
America. Even if the supposed continent of "Gondwana
Land" extended from Africa to South America in equatorial
latitudes, strong currents must still have flowed
westward along its northern shore under the impulse of
the peculiarly strong trade winds which the equatorial
land would create. Nevertheless at such times relatively
little warm tropical water presumably entered the North
Atlantic, for it escaped into the Pacific. At several other
times, such as the late Ordovician and mid-Devonian,
when the isthmian barrier existed, it probably turned an
important current northward into what is now the Mississippi
Basin instead of into the Atlantic. There it
traversed an epeiric, or mid-continental sea open to both
north and south. Hence its effectiveness in warming
Arctic regions must have been quite different from that
of the present Gulf Stream.</p>
<!--File: cc228.png Page 204-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_204" title="pg 204"></a>

<p>(b) We will next consider the influences of changes in
the amount of equatorial and tropical land. As such lands
are much hotter than the corresponding seas, the intensity
and width of the equatorial belt of low pressure must
be great when they are extensive. Hence the trade winds
must have been stronger than now whenever tropical
lands were more extensive than at present. This is because
the trades are produced by the convection due to
excessive heat along the heat equator. There the air
expands upward and flows poleward at high altitudes.
The trade wind consists of air moving toward the heat
equator to take the place of the air which there rises.
When the lands in low latitudes were wide the trade
winds must also have dominated a wide belt. The greater
width of the trade-wind belt today over Africa than over
the Atlantic illustrates the matter. The belt must have
been still wider when Gondwana Land was large, as it is
believed to have been during the Paleozoic era and the
early Mesozoic.</p>

<p>An increase in the width of the equatorial belt of
low pressure under the influence of broad tropical lands
would be accompanied not only by stronger and more
widespread trade winds, but by a corresponding strengthening
of the subtropical belts of high pressure. The chief
reason would be the greater expansion of the air in the
equatorial low pressure belt and the consequent more
abundant outflow of air at high altitudes in the form of
anti-trades or winds returning poleward above the trades.
Such winds would pile up the air in the region of the high-pressure
belt. Moreover, since the meridians converge as
one proceeds away from the equator, the air of the poleward-moving
anti-trades tends to be crowded as it
reaches higher latitudes, thus increasing the pressure.
Unless there were a corresponding increase in tropical
<!--File: cc229.png Page 205-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_205" title="pg 205"></a>
cyclones, one of the most prominent results of the
strengthened trades and the intensified subtropical high-pressure
belt at times of broad lands in low latitudes
would be great deserts. It will be recalled that the trade-wind
lowlands and the extra-tropical belt of highs are the
great desert belts at present. The trade-wind lowlands
are desert because air moving into warmer latitudes
takes up water except where it is cooled by rising on
mountain-sides. The belt of highs is arid because there,
too, air is being warmed, but in this case by descending
from aloft.</p>

<p>Again, if the atmospheric pressure in the subtropical
belt should be intensified, the winds flowing poleward
from this belt would necessarily become stronger. These
would begin as southwesterlies in the northern hemisphere
and northwesterlies in the southern. In the preceding
chapter we have seen that such winds, especially
when cyclonic storms are few and mild, are a powerful
agent in transferring subtropical heat poleward. If the
strength of the westerlies were increased because of
broad lands in low latitudes, their efficacy in transferring
heat would be correspondingly augmented. It is thus
evident that any change in the extent of tropical lands
during the geologic past must have had important climatic
consequences in changing the velocity of the
atmospheric circulation and in altering the transfer of
heat from low latitudes to high. When the equatorial and
tropical lands were broad the winds and currents must
have been strong, much heat must have been carried
away from low latitudes, and the contrast between low
and high latitudes must have been relatively slight. As
we have already remarked, leading paleogeographers
believe that changes in the extent of the lands have been
especially marked in low latitudes, and that on the average
<!--File: cc230.png Page 206-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_206" title="pg 206"></a>
there has been a decrease in the extent of land within
the tropics. Gondwana Land is the greatest illustration
of this. In the same way, on the numerous paleogeographic
maps of North America, most paleogeographers
have shown fairly extensive lands south of the latitude of
the United States during most of the geologic epochs.<sup><a href="#fn90" id="r90">[90]</a></sup></p>

<p>(c) There is evidence that during geologic history the
area of the lands in middle and high latitudes, as well as
in low latitudes, has changed radically. An increase in
such lands would cause the winters to grow colder. This
would be partly because of the loss of heat by radiation
into the cold dry air over the continents in winter, and
partly because of increased reflection from snow and
frost, which gather much more widely upon the land than
upon the ocean. Furthermore, in winter when the continents
are relatively cold, there is a strong tendency for
winds to blow out from the continent toward the ocean.
The larger the land the stronger this tendency. In Asia
it gives rise to strong winter monsoons. The effect of
such winds is illustrated by the way in which the westerlies
prevent the Gulf Stream from warming the eastern
United States in winter. The Gulf Stream warms northwestern
Europe much more than the United States because,
in Europe, the prevailing winds are onshore.</p>

<p>Another effect of an increase in the area of the lands in
middle and high latitudes would be to interpose barriers
to oceanic circulation and thus lower the temperature
of polar regions. This would not mean glaciation in
high latitudes, however, even when the lands were widespread
as in the Mesozoic and early Tertiary. Students
of glaciology are more and more thoroughly convinced


<!--File: cc231.png Page 207-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_207" title="pg 207"></a>
that glaciation depends on the availability of moisture
even more than upon low temperature.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be noted that each of the several
climatic influences of increased land area in the high
latitudes would tend to increase the contrasts between
land and sea, between winter and summer, and between
low latitudes and high. In other words, so far as the
effect upon high latitudes themselves is concerned, an
expansion of the lands there would tend in the same
direction as a diminution in low latitudes. In so far as
the general trend of geological evolution has been toward
more land in high latitudes and less in low, it would help
to produce a progressive increase in climatic diversity
such as is faintly indicated in the rock strata. On the
other hand, the oscillations in the distribution of the
lands, of which geology affords so much evidence, must
certainly have played an important part in producing the
periodic changes of climate which the earth has undergone.</p>

<p>III. Throughout geological history there is abundant
evidence that the process of contraction has led to
marked differences not only in the distribution and area
of the lands, but in their height. On the whole the lands
have presumably increased in height since the Proterozoic,
somewhat in proportion to the increased differentiation
of continents and oceans.<sup><a href="#fn91" id="r91">[91]</a></sup> If there has been such an
increase, the contrast between the climate of ocean and
land must have been accentuated, for highlands have a
greater diurnal and seasonal range of temperature than
do lowlands. The ocean has very little range of either
sort. The large range at high altitudes is due chiefly to
the small quantity of water vapor, for this declines
<!--File: cc232.png Page 208-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_208" title="pg 208"></a>
steadily with increased altitude. A diminution in the
density of the other constituents of the air also decreases
the blanketing effect of the atmosphere. In conformity
with the great seasonal range in temperature at times
when the lands stand high, the direction of the wind
would be altered. When the lands are notably warmer
than the oceans, the winds commonly flow from land to
sea, and when the continents are much colder than the
oceans, the direction is reversed. The monsoons of Asia
are examples. Strong seasonal winds disturb the normal
planetary circulation of the trade winds in low latitudes
and of the westerlies in middle latitudes. They also interfere
with the ocean currents set in motion by the planetary
winds. The net result is to hinder the transfer of
heat from low latitudes to high, and thus to increase the
contrasts between the zones. Local as well as zonal contrasts
are also intensified. The higher the land, the
greater, relatively speaking, are the cloudiness and precipitation
on seaward slopes, and the drier the interior.
Indeed, most highlands are arid. Henry's<sup><a href="#fn92" id="r92">[92]</a></sup> recent study
of the vertical distribution of rainfall on mountain-sides
indicates that a decrease sets in at about 3500 feet in the
tropics and only a little higher in mid-latitudes.</p>

<p>In addition to the main effects upon atmospheric circulation
and precipitation, each of the many upheavals
of the lands must have been accompanied by many minor
conditions which tended toward diversity. For example,
the streams were rejuvenated, and instead of meandering
perhaps over vast flood plains they intrenched their
channels and in many cases dug deep gorges. The water
table was lowered, soil was removed from considerable
areas, the bare rock was exposed, and the type of dominant
<!--File: cc233.png Page 209-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_209" title="pg 209"></a>
vegetation altered in many places. An almost barren
ridge may represent all that remains of what was once a
vast forested flood plain. Thus, increased elevation of the
land produces contrasted conditions of slope, vegetation,
availability of ground water, exposure to wind and so
forth, and these unite in diversifying climate. Where
mountains are formed, strong contrasts are sure to
occur. The windward slopes may be very rainy, while
neighboring leeward slopes are parched by a dry foehn
wind. At the same time the tops may be snow-covered.
Increased local contrasts in climatic conditions are
known to influence the intensity of cyclonic storms,<sup><a href="#fn93" id="r93">[93]</a></sup> and
these affect the climatic conditions of all middle and high
latitudes, if not of the entire earth. The paths followed
by cyclonic storms are also altered by increased contrast
between land and water. When the continents are notably
colder than the neighboring oceans, high atmospheric
pressure develops on the lands and interferes with the
passage of lows, which are therefore either deflected
around the continent or forced to move slowly.</p>

<p>The distribution of lofty mountains has an even more
striking climatic effect than the general uplift of a region.
In Proterozoic times there was a great range in the Lake
Superior region; in the late Devonian the Acadian mountains
of New England and the Maritime Provinces of
Canada possibly attained a height equal to the present
Rockies. Subsequently, in the late Paleozoic a significant
range stood where the Ouachitas now are. Accompanying
the uplift of each of these ranges, and all others, the
climate of the surrounding area, especially to leeward,
must have been altered greatly. Many extensive salt deposits
<!--File: cc234.png Page 210-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_210" title="pg 210"></a>
found now in fairly humid regions, for example,
the Pennsylvanian and Permian deposits of Kansas and
Oklahoma, were probably laid down in times of local
aridity due to the cutting off of moisture-bearing winds
by the mountains of Llanoria in Louisiana and Texas.
Hence such deposits do not necessarily indicate periods
of widespread and profound aridity.</p>

<p>When the causes of ancient glaciation were first considered
by geologists, about the middle of the nineteenth
century, it was usually assumed that the glaciated areas
had been elevated to great heights, and thus rendered
cold enough to permit the accumulation of glaciers. The
many glaciers occurring in the Alps of central Europe
where glaciology arose doubtless suggested this explanation.
However, it is now known that most of the ancient
glaciation was not of the alpine type, and there is adequate
proof that the glacial periods cannot be explained
as due directly and solely to uplift. Nevertheless, upheavals
of the lands are among the most important factors
in controlling climate, and variations in the height
of the lands have doubtless assisted in producing climate
oscillations, especially those of long duration. Moreover,
the progressive increase in the height of the lands has
presumably played a part in fostering local and zonal
diversity in contrast with the relative uniformity of
earlier geological times.</p>

<p>IV. The contraction of the earth has been accompanied
by volcanic activity as well as by changes in the extent,
distribution, and altitude of the lands. The probable part
played by volcanic dust as a contributory factor in producing
short sudden climatic variations has already been
discussed. There is, however, another though probably
less important respect in which volcanic activity may
have had at least a slight climatic significance. The oldest
<!--File: cc235.png Page 211-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_211" title="pg 211"></a>
known rocks, those of the Archean era, contain so much
igneous matter that many students have assumed that
they show that the entire earth was once liquid. It is now
considered that they merely indicate igneous activity of
great magnitude. In the later part of Proterozoic time,
during the second quarter of the earth's history according
to Schuchert's estimate, there were again vast outflowings
of lava. In the Lake Superior district, for example,
a thickness of more than a mile accumulated over
a large area, and lavas are common in many areas where
rocks of this age are known. The next quarter of the
earth's history elapsed without any correspondingly
great outflows so far as is known, though several lesser
ones occurred. Toward the end of the last quarter, and
hence quite recently from the geological standpoint,
another period of outflows, perhaps as noteworthy as
that of the Proterozoic, occurred in the Cretaceous and
Tertiary.</p>

<p>The climatic effects of such extensive lava flows would
be essentially as follows: In the first place so long as the
lavas were hot they would set up a local system of convection
with inflowing winds. This would interfere at
least a little with the general winds of the area. Again,
where the lava flowed out into water, or where rain fell
upon hot lava, there would be rapid evaporation which
would increase the rainfall. Then after the lava had
cooled, it would still influence climate a trifle in so far as
its color was notably darker or lighter than that of the
average surface. Dark surfaces absorb solar heat and
become relatively warm when the sun shines upon them.
Dark objects likewise radiate heat more rapidly than
light-colored objects. Hence they cool more rapidly at
night, and in the winter. As most lavas are relatively
dark they increase the average diurnal range of temperature.
<!--File: cc236.png Page 212-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_212" title="pg 212"></a>
Hence even after they are cool they increase the
climatic diversity of the land.</p>

<p>The amount of heat given to the atmosphere by an
extensive lava flow, though large according to human
standards, is small compared with the amount received
from the sun by a like area, except during the first few
weeks or months before the lava has formed a thick
crust. Furthermore, probably only a small fraction of
any large series of flows occurred in a given century or
millennium. Moreover, even the largest lava flows covered
an area of only a few hundredths of one per cent of the
earth's surface. Nevertheless, the conditions which modify
climate are so complicated that it would be rash to
state that this amount of additional heat has been of
no climatic significance. Like the proverbial "straw that
broke the camel's back," the changes it would surely
produce in local convection, atmospheric pressure, and
the direction of the wind may have helped to shift the
paths of storms and to produce other complications which
were of appreciable climatic significance.</p>

<p>V. The last point which we shall consider in connection
with the effect of the earth's interior upon climate is
internal heat. The heat given off by lavas is merely a
small part of that which is emitted by the earth as a
whole. In the earliest part of geological history enough
heat may have escaped from the interior of the earth to
exert a profound influence on the climate. Knowlton,<sup><a href="#fn94" id="r94">[94]</a></sup>
as we have seen, has recently built up an elaborate theory
on this assumption. At present, however, accurate measurements
show that the escape of heat is so slight that
it has no appreciable influence except in a few volcanic
<!--File: cc237.png Page 213-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_213" title="pg 213"></a>
areas. It is estimated to raise the average temperature
of the earth's surface less than 0.1&deg;C.<sup><a href="#fn95" id="r95">[95]</a></sup></p>

<p>In order to contribute enough heat to raise the surface
temperature 1&deg;C., the temperature gradient from the
interior of the earth to the surface would need to be ten
times as great as now, for the rate of conduction varies
directly with the gradient. If the gradient were ten times
as great as now, the rocks at a depth of two and one-half
miles would be so hot as to be almost liquid according to
Barrell's<sup><a href="#fn96" id="r96">[96]</a></sup> estimates. The thick strata of unmetamorphosed
Paleozoic rocks indicate that such high temperatures
have not prevailed at such slight depths since the
Proterozoic. Furthermore, the fact that the climate was
cold enough to permit glaciation early in the Proterozoic
era and at from one to three other times before the opening
of the Paleozoic suggests that the rate of escape of
heat was not rapid even in the first half of the earth's
recorded history. Yet even if the general escape of heat
has never been large since the beginning of the better-known
part of geological history, it was presumably
greater in early times than at present.</p>

<p>If there actually has been an appreciable decrease in
the amount of heat given out by the earth's interior, its
effects would agree with the observed conditions of the
geological record. It would help to explain the relative
mildness of zonal, seasonal, and local contrasts of climate
in early geological times, but it would not help to explain
the long oscillations from era to era which appear to have
been of much greater importance. Those oscillations, so
far as we can yet judge, may have been due in part to
solar changes, but in large measure they seem to be
<!--File: cc238.png Page 214-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_214" title="pg 214"></a>
explained by variations in the extent, distribution, and
altitude of the lands. Such variations appear to be the
inevitable result of the earth's contraction.</p>

<h3>POST-GLACIAL CRUSTAL MOVEMENTS AND
CLIMATIC CHANGES</h3>


<p>An interesting practical application of some of the
preceding generalizations is found in an attempt
by C. E. P. Brooks<sup><a href="#fn97" id="r97">[97]</a></sup> to interpret post-glacial
climatic changes almost entirely in terms of crustal movement.
We believe that he carries the matter much too far,
but his discussion is worthy of rather full recapitulation,
not only for its theoretical value but because it gives a
good summary of post-glacial changes. His climatic table
for northwest Europe as reprinted from the annual report
of the Smithsonian Institution for 1917, p. 366, is

<p>Brooks bases his chronology largely on De Geer's
measurements of the annual layers of clay in lake
<!--File: cc240.png Page 216-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_216" title="pg 216"></a>
bottoms but makes much use of other evidence. According
to Brooks the last glacial epoch lasted roughly from
30,000 to 18,000 B. C., but this includes a slight amelioration
of climate followed by a readvance of the ice, known
as the Buhl stage. During the time of maximum glaciation
the British Isles stood twenty or thirty feet higher
than now and Scandinavia was "considerably" more
elevated. The author believes that this caused a fall of
1&deg;C. in the temperature of the British Isles and of 2&deg;C.
in Scandinavia. By an ingenious though not wholly convincing
method of calculation he concludes that this
lowering of temperature, aided by an increase in the area
of the lands, sufficed to start an ice sheet in Scandinavia.
The relatively small area of ice cooled the air and gave
rise to an area of high barometric pressure. This in turn
is supposed to have caused further expansion of the ice
and to have led to full-fledged glaciation.</p>

<p>About 18,000 B. C. the retreat of the ice began in good
earnest. Even though no evidence has yet been found,
Brooks believes there must have been a change in the distribution
of land and sea to account for the diminution of
the ice. The ensuing millenniums formed the Magdalenian
period in human history, the last stage of the Paleolithic,
when man lived in caves and reindeer were abundant
in central Europe.<sup><a href="#fn98" id="r98">[98]</a></sup> At first the ice retreated very
slowly and there were periods when for scores of years
the ice edge remained stationary or even readvanced.
About 10,000 B. C. the edge of the ice lay along the
southern coast of Sweden. During the next 2000 years it
withdrew more rapidly to about 59&deg;N. Then came the
Fennoscandian pause, or Gschnitz stage, when for about
<!--File: cc241.png Page 217-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_217" title="pg 217"></a>
200 years the ice edge remained in one position, forming
a great moraine. Brooks suggests that this pause about
8000 B. C. was due to the closing of the connection between
the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea and the
synchronous opening of a connection between the Baltic
and the White Seas, whereby cold Arctic waters replaced
the warmer Atlantic waters. He notes, however, that
about 7500 B. C. the obliquity of the ecliptic was probably
nearly 1&deg; greater than at present. This he calculates to
have caused the climate of Germany and Sweden to be
1&deg;F. colder than at present in winter and 1&deg;F. warmer in
summer.</p>

<p>The next climatic stage was marked by a rise of temperature
till about 6000 B. C. During this period the ice
at first retreated, presumably because the climate was
ameliorating, although no cause of such amelioration is
assigned. At length the ice lay far enough north to allow
a connection between the Baltic and the Atlantic by way
of Lakes Wener and Wetter in southern Sweden. This is
supposed to have warmed the Baltic Sea and to have
caused the climate to become distinctly milder. Next the
land rose once more so that the Baltic was separated
from the Atlantic and was converted into the Ancylus
lake of fresh water. The southwest Baltic region then
stood 400 feet higher than now. The result was the Daun
stage, about 5000 B. C., when the ice halted or perhaps
readvanced a little, its front being then near Ragunda
in about latitude 63&deg;. Why such an elevation did not
cause renewed glaciation instead of merely the slight
Daun pause, Brooks does not explain, although his calculations
as to the effect of a slight elevation of the land
during the main period of glaciation from 30,000 to
18,000 B. C. would seem to demand a marked readvance.</p>
<!--File: cc242.png Page 218-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_218" title="pg 218"></a>

<p>After 5000 B. C. there ensued a period when the climate,
although still distinctly continental, was relatively
mild. The winters, to be sure, were still cold but the
summers were increasingly warm. In Sweden, for example,
the types of vegetation indicate that the summer
temperature was 7&deg;F. higher than now. Storms, Brooks
assumes, were comparatively rare except on the outer
fringe of Great Britain. There they were sufficiently
abundant so that in the Northwest they gave rise to the
first Peat-Bog period, during which swamps replaced
forests of birch and pine. Southern and eastern England,
however, probably had a dry continental climate. Even
in northwest Norway storms were rare as is indicated by
remains of forests on islands now barren because of the
strong winds and fierce storms. Farther east most parts
of central and northern Europe were relatively dry. This
was the early Neolithic period when man advanced from
the use of unpolished to polished stone implements.</p>

<p>Not far from 4000 B. C. the period of continental climate
was replaced by a comparatively moist maritime
climate. Brooks believes that this was because submergence
opened the mouth of the Baltic and caused the
fresh Ancylus lake to give place to the so-called Litorina
sea. The temperature in Sweden averaged about 3&deg;F.
higher than at present and in southwestern Norway 2&deg;.
More important than this was the small annual range of
temperature due to the fact that the summers were cool
while the winters were mild. Because of the presence of
a large expanse of water in the Baltic region, storms, as
our author states, then crossed Great Britain and followed
the Baltic depression, carrying the moisture far
inland. In spite of the additional moisture thus available
the snow line in southern Norway was higher than now.</p>

<p>At this point Brooks turns to other parts of the world.
<!--File: cc243.png Page 219-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_219" title="pg 219"></a>
He states that not far from 4000 B. C., a submergence
of the lands, rarely amounting to more than twenty-five
feet, took place not only in the Baltic region but in Ireland,
Iceland, Spitzbergen, and other parts of the Arctic
Ocean, as well as in the White Sea, Greenland, and the
eastern part of North America. Evidences of a mild climate
are found in all those places. Similar evidence of a
mild warm climate is found in East Africa, East Australia,
Tierra del Fuego, and Antarctica. The dates are
not established with certainty but they at least fall in the
period immediately preceding the present epoch. In explanation
of these conditions Brooks assumes a universal
change of sea level. He suggests with some hesitation
that this may have been due to one of Pettersson's
periods of maximum "tide-generating force." According
to Pettersson the varying positions of the moon, earth,
and sun cause the tides to vary in cycles of about 9, 90,
and 1800 years, though the length of the periods is not
constant. When tides are high there is great movement
of ocean waters and hence a great mixture of the water
at different latitudes. This is supposed to cause an
amelioration of climate. The periods of maximum and
minimum tide-generating force are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maxima &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  3500 B. C. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 2100 B. C. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 350 B. C. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; A. D. 1434<br />
Minima &nbsp; &nbsp;  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 2800 B. C. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 1200 B. C. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; A. D. 530 &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brooks thinks that the big trees in California and the
Norse sagas and Germanic myths indicate a rough agreement
of climatic phenomena with Pettersson's last three
dates, while the mild climate of 4000 B. C. may really
belong to 3500 B. C. He gives no evidence confirming
Pettersson's view at the other three dates.</p>

<p>To return to Brooks' sketch of the relation of climatic
pulsations to the altitude of the lands, by 3000 B. C., that
<!--File: cc244.png Page 220-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_220" title="pg 220"></a>
is, toward the close of the Neolithic period, further elevation
is supposed to have taken place over the central
latitudes of western Europe. Southern Britain, which had
remained constantly above its present level ever since
30,000 B. C., was perhaps ninety feet higher than now.
Ireland was somewhat enlarged by elevation, the Straits
of Dover were almost closed, and parts of the present
North Sea were land. To these conditions Brooks ascribes
the prevalence of a dry continental climate. The storms
shifted northward once more, the winds were mild, as
seems to be proved by remains of trees in exposed places;
and forests replaced fields of peat and heath in Britain
and Germany. The summers were perhaps warmer than
now but the winters were severe. The relatively dry climate
prevailed as far west as Ireland. For example, in
Drumkelin Bog in Donegal County a corded oak road and
a two-story log cabin appear to belong to this time. Fourteen
feet of bog lie below the floor and twenty-six above.
This period, perhaps 3000-2000 B. C., was the legendary
heroic age of Ireland when "the vigour of the Irish
reached a level not since attained." This, as Brooks
points out, may have been a result of the relatively dry
climate, for today the extreme moisture of Ireland seems
to be a distinct handicap. In Scandinavia, civilization, or
at least the stage of relative progress, was also high at
this time.</p>

<p>By 1600 B. C. the land had assumed nearly its present
level in the British Isles and the southern Baltic
region, while northern Scandinavia still stood lower than
now. The climate of Britain and Germany was so humid
that there was an extensive formation of peat even on
high ground not before covered. This moist stage seems
to have lasted almost to the time of Christ, and may have
been the reason why the Romans described Britain as
<!--File: cc245.png Page 221-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_221" title="pg 221"></a>
peculiarly wet and damp. At this point Brooks again departs
from northwest Europe to a wider field:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is possible that we have to attribute this damp period in
Northwest Europe to some more general cause, for Ellsworth
Huntington's curves of tree-growth in California and climate
in Western Asia both show moister conditions from about
1000 B. C. to A. D. 200, and the same author believes that the
Mediterranean lands had a heavier rainfall about 500 B. C. to
A. D. 200. It seems that the phase was marked by a general increase
of the storminess of the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere at least, with a maximum between Ireland and North
Germany, indicating probably that the Baltic again became the
favourite track of depressions from the Atlantic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brooks ends his paper with a brief r&eacute;sum&eacute; of glacial
changes in North America, but as the means of dating
events are unreliable the degree of synchronism with
Europe is not clear. He sums up his conclusions as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the whole it appears that though there is a general similarity
in the climatic history of the two sides of the North
Atlantic, the changes are not really contemporaneous, and such
relationship as appears is due mainly to the natural similarity
in the geographical history of two regions both recovering from
an Ice Age, and only very partially to world-wide pulsations
of climate. Additional evidence on this head will be available
when Baron de Geer publishes the results of his recent investigations
of the seasonal glacial clays of North America, especially
if, as he hopes, he is able to correlate the banding of these clays
with the growth-rings of the big trees.</p>

<p>When we turn to the northwest of North America, this is
brought out very markedly. For in Yukon and Alaska the Ice
Age was a very mild affair compared with its severity in eastern
America and Scandinavia. As the land had not a heavy ice-load
to recover from, there were no complicated geographical
<!--File: cc246.png Page 222-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_222" title="pg 222"></a>
changes. Also, there were no fluctuations of climate, but simply
a gradual passage to present conditions. The latter circumstance
especially seems to show that the emphasis laid on geographical
rather than astronomical factors of <em>great</em> climatic changes is
not misplaced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brooks' painstaking discussion of post-glacial climatic
changes is of great value because of the large body of
material which he has so carefully wrought together. His
strong belief in the importance of changes in the level of
the lands deserves serious consideration. It is difficult,
however, to accept his final conclusion that such changes
are the main factors in recent climatic changes. It is almost
impossible, for example, to believe that movements
of the land could produce almost the same series of
climatic changes in Europe, Central Asia, the western
and eastern parts of North America, and the southern
hemisphere. Yet such changes appear to have occurred
during and since the glacial period. Again there is no
evidence whatever that movements of the land have anything
to do with the historic cycles of climate or with the
cycles of weather in our own day, which seem to be the
same as glacial cycles on a small scale. Also, as Dr.
Simpson points out in discussing Brooks' paper, there
appears "no solution along these lines of the problem
connected with rich vegetation in both polar circles and
the ice-age which produced the ice-sheet at sea-level in
Northern India." Nevertheless, we may well believe that
Brooks is right in holding that changes in the relative
level and relative area of land and sea have had important
local effects. While they are only one of the
factors involved in climatic changes, they are certainly
one that must constantly be kept in mind.</p>

<h3>THE CHANGING COMPOSITION OF OCEANS AND
ATMOSPHERE</h3>


<p>Having discussed the climatic effect of movements
of the earth's crust during the course of
geological time, we are now ready to consider
the corresponding effects due to changes in the movable
envelopes&mdash;the oceans and the atmosphere. Variations in
the composition of sea water and of air and in the
amount of air must almost certainly have occurred, and
must have produced at least slight climatic consequences.
It should be pointed out at once that such variations
appear to be far less important climatically than do
movements of the earth's crust and changes in the activity
of the sun. Moreover, in most cases, they are not
reversible as are the crustal and solar phenomena. Hence,
while most of them appear to have been unimportant so
far as climatic oscillations and fluctuations are concerned,
they seemingly have aided in producing the slight secular
progression to which we have so often referred.</p>

<p>There is general agreement among geologists that the
ocean has become increasingly saline throughout the
ages. Indeed, calculations of the rate of accumulation of
salt have been a favorite method of arriving at estimates
of the age of the ocean, and hence of the earliest marine
sediments. So far as known, however, no geologist or
climatologist has discussed the probable climatic effects
<!--File: cc248.png Page 224-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_224" title="pg 224"></a>
of increased salinity. Yet it seems clear that an increase
in salinity must have a slight effect upon climate.</p>

<p>Salinity affects climate in four ways: (1) It appreciably
influences the rate of evaporation; (2) it alters
the freezing point; (3) it produces certain indirect
effects through changes in the absorption of carbon
dioxide; and (4) it has an effect on oceanic circulation.</p>

<p>(1) According to the experiments of Mazelle and
Okada, as reported by Kr&uuml;mmel,<sup><a href="#fn99" id="r99">[99]</a></sup> evaporation from ordinary
sea water is from 9 to 30 per cent less rapid than
from fresh water under similar conditions. The variation
from 9 to 30 per cent found in the experiments depends,
perhaps, upon the wind velocity. When salt water
is stagnant, rapid evaporation tends to result in the
development of a film of salt on the top of the water,
especially where it is sheltered from the wind. Such a film
necessarily reduces evaporation. Hence the relatively
low salinity of the oceans in the past probably had a
tendency to increase the amount of water vapor in the
air. Even a little water vapor augments slightly the
blanketing effect of the air and to that extent diminishes
the diurnal and seasonal range of temperature and the
contrast from zone to zone.</p>

<p>(2) Increased salinity means a lower freezing temperature
of the oceans and hence would have an effect
during cold periods such as the present and the Pleistocene
ice age. It would not, however, be of importance
during the long warm periods which form most of
geologic time. A salinity of about 3.5 per cent at present
lowers the freezing point of the ocean roughly 2&deg;C. below
that of fresh water. If the ocean were fresh and our
winters as cold as now, all the harbors of New England
and the Middle Atlantic States would be icebound. The
<!--File: cc249.png Page 225-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_225" title="pg 225"></a>
Baltic Sea would also be frozen each winter, and even
the eastern harbors of the British Isles would be frequently
locked in ice. At high latitudes the area of permanently
frozen oceans would be much enlarged. The
effect of such a condition upon marine life in high latitudes
would be like that of a change to a warmer climate.
It would protect the life on the continental shelf from the
severe battering of winter storms. It would also lessen
the severity of the winter temperature in the water for
when water freezes it gives up much latent heat,&mdash;eighty
calories per cubic centimeter. Part of this raises the
temperature of the underlying water.</p>

<p>The expansion of the ice near northern shores would
influence the life of the lands quite differently from that
of the oceans. It would act like an addition of land to the
continents and would, therefore, increase the atmospheric
contrasts from zone to zone and from continental interior
to ocean. In summer the ice upon the sea would tend to
keep the coastal lands cool, very much as happens now
near the Arctic Ocean, where the ice floes have a great
effect through their reflection of light and their absorption
of heat in melting. In winter the virtual enlargement
of the continents by the addition of an ice fringe would
decrease the snowfall upon the lands. Still more important
would be the effect in intensifying the anti-cyclonic
conditions which normally prevail in winter not
only over continents but over ice-covered oceans. Hence
the outblowing cold winds would he strengthened.<sup><a href="#fn100" id="r100">[100]</a></sup> The
net effect of all these conditions would apparently be a
diminution of snowfall in high latitudes upon the lands
even though the summer snowfall upon the ocean and the

<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_226" title="pg 226"></a>
coasts may have increased. This condition may have been
one reason why widespread glaciation does not appear to
have prevailed in high latitudes during the Proterozoic
and Permian glaciations, even though it occurred farther
south. If the ocean during those early glacial epochs
were ice-covered down to middle latitudes, a lack of extensive
glaciation in high latitudes would be no more
surprising than is the lack of Pleistocene glaciation in
the northern parts of Alaska and Asia. Great ice sheets
are impossible without a large supply of moisture.</p>

<p>(3) Among the indirect effects of salinity one of the
chief appears to be that the low salinity of the water in
the past and the greater ease with which it froze presumably
allowed the temperature of the entire ocean to be
slightly higher than now. This is because ice serves as a
blanket and hinders the radiation of heat from the underlying
water. The temperature of the ocean has a climatic
significance not only directly, but indirectly through its
influence on the amount of carbon dioxide held by the
oceans. A change of even 1&deg;C. from the present mean
temperature of 2&deg;C. would alter the ability of the entire
ocean to absorb carbon dioxide by about 4 per cent. This,
according to F. W. Clarke,<sup><a href="#fn101" id="r101">[101]</a></sup> is because the oceans contain
from eighteen to twenty-seven times as much carbon
dioxide as the air when only the free carbon dioxide is
considered, and about seventy times as much according
to Johnson and Williamson<sup><a href="#fn102" id="r102">[102]</a></sup> when the partially combined
carbon dioxide is also considered. Moreover, the capacity
of water for carbon dioxide varies sharply with the temperature.<sup><a href="#fn103" id="r103">[103]</a></sup>
Hence a rise in temperature of only 1&deg;C.
would theoretically cause the oceans to give up from 30
<!--File: cc251.png Page 227-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_227" title="pg 227"></a>
to 280 times as much carbon dioxide as the air now holds.
This, however, is on the unfounded assumption that the
oceans are completely saturated. The important point is
merely that a slight change in ocean temperature would
cause a disproportionately large change in the amount
of carbon dioxide in the air with all that this implies in
respect to blanketing the earth, and thus altering temperature.</p>

<p>(4) Another and perhaps the most important effect of
salinity upon climate depends upon the rapidity of the
deep-sea circulation. The circulation is induced by differences
of temperature, but its speed is affected at least
slightly by salinity. The vertical circulation is now dominated
by cold water from subpolar latitudes. Except in
closed seas like the Mediterranean the lower portions
of the ocean are near the freezing point. This is because
cold water sinks in high latitudes by reason of its superior
density, and then "creeps" to low latitudes. There
it finally rises and replaces either the water driven poleward
by the winds, or that which has evaporated from
the Surface.<sup><a href="#fn104" id="r104">[104]</a></sup></p>

<p>During past ages, when the sea water was less salty,
the circulation was presumably more rapid than now.
This was because, in tropical regions, the rise of cold
<!--File: cc252.png Page 228-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_228" title="pg 228"></a>
water is hindered by the sinking of warm surface water
which is relatively dense because evaporation has removed
part of the water and caused an accumulation of
salt. According to Kr&uuml;mmel and Mill,<sup><a href="#fn105" id="r105">[105]</a></sup> the surface salinity
of the subtropical belt of the North Atlantic commonly
exceeds 3.7 per cent and sometimes reaches 3.77 per cent,
whereas the underlying waters have a salinity of less
than 3.5 per cent and locally as little as 3.44 per cent.
The other oceans are slightly less saline than the North
Atlantic at all depths, but the vertical salinity gradients
along the tropics are similar. According to the Smithsonian
Physical Tables, the difference in salinity between
the surface water and that lying below is equivalent to
a difference of .003 in density, where the density of fresh
water is taken as 1.000. Since the decrease in density produced
by warming water from the temperature of its
greatest density (4&deg;C.) to the highest temperatures
which ever prevail in the ocean (30&deg;C. or 86&deg;F.) is only
.004, the more saline surface waters of the dry tropics
are at most times almost as dense as the less saline but
colder waters beneath the surface, which have come from
higher latitudes. During days of especially great evaporation,
however, the most saline portions of the surface
waters in the dry tropics are denser than the underlying
waters and therefore sink, and produce a temporary local
stagnation in the general circulation. Such a sinking of
the warm surface waters is reported by Kr&uuml;mmel, who
detected it by means of the rise in temperature which it
produces at considerable depths. If such a hindrance to
the circulation did not exist, the velocity of the deep-sea
movements would be greater.</p>

<p>If in earlier times a more rapid circulation occurred,
low latitudes must have been cooled more than now by
<!--File: cc253.png Page 229-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_229" title="pg 229"></a>
the rise of cold waters. At the same time higher latitudes
were presumably warmed by a greater flow of warm
water from tropical regions because less of the surface
heat sank in low latitudes. Such conditions would tend to
lessen the climatic contrast between the different latitudes.
Hence, in so far as the rate of deep-sea circulation
depends upon salinity, the slowly increasing amount of
salt in the oceans must have tended to increase the contrasts
between low and high latitudes. Thus for several
reasons, the increase of salinity during geologic history
seems to deserve a place among the minor agencies which
help to explain the apparent tendency toward a secular
progression of climate in the direction of greater contrasts
between tropical and subpolar latitudes.</p>

<p>Changes in the composition and amount of the atmosphere
have presumably had a climatic importance greater
than that of changes in the salinity of the oceans. The
atmospheric changes may have been either progressive
or cyclic, or both. In early times, according to the nebular
hypothesis, the atmosphere was much more dense than
now and contained a larger percentage of certain constituents,
notably carbon dioxide and water. The planetesimal
hypothesis, on the other hand, postulates an increase
in the density of the atmosphere, for according to
this hypothesis the density of the atmosphere depends
upon the power of the earth to hold gases, and this power
increases as the earth grows bigger with the infall of
material from without.<sup><a href="#fn106" id="r106">[106]</a></sup></p>

<p>Whichever hypothesis may be correct, it seems probable
that when life first appeared on the land the atmosphere
resembled that of today in certain fundamental
respects. It contained the elements essential to life, and
<!--File: cc254.png Page 230-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_230" title="pg 230"></a>
its blanketing effect was such as to maintain temperatures
not greatly different from those of the present. The
evidence of this depends largely upon the narrow limits
of temperature within which the activities of modern
life are possible, and upon the cumulative evidence that
ancient life was essentially similar to the types now
living. The resemblance between some of the oldest
forms and those of today is striking. For example,
according to Professor Schuchert:<sup><a href="#fn107" id="r107">[107]</a></sup> "Many of the living
genera of forest trees had their origin in the Cretaceous,
and the giant sequoias of California go back to the Triassic,
while Ginkgo is known in the Permian. Some of the
fresh-water molluscs certainly were living in the early
periods of the Mesozoic, and the lung-fish of today
(Ceratodus) is known as far back as the Triassic and is
not very unlike other lung-fishes of the Devonian. The
higher vertebrates and insects, on the other hand, are
very sensitive to their environment, and therefore do not
extend back generically beyond the Cenozoic, and only in
a few instances even as far as the Oligocene. Of marine
invertebrates the story is very different, for it is well
known that the horseshoe crab (Limulus) lived in the
Upper Jurassic, and Nautilus in the Triassic, with forms
in the Devonian not far removed from this genus. Still
longer-ranging genera occur among the brachiopods, for
living Lingula and Crania have specific representatives
as far back as the early Ordovician. Among living foraminifers,
Lagena, Globigerina, and Nodosaria are known
in the later Cambrian or early Ordovician. In the Middle
Cambrian near Field, British Columbia, Walcott has
found a most varied array of invertebrates among which
are crustaceans not far removed from living forms.
Zo&ouml;logists who see these wonderful fossils are at once
<!--File: cc255.png Page 231-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_231" title="pg 231"></a>
struck with their modernity and the little change that has
taken place in certain stocks since that far remote time.
Back of the Paleozoic, little can be said of life from the
generic standpoint, since so few fossils have been recovered,
but what is at hand suggests that the marine
environment was similar to that of today."</p>

<p>At present, as we have repeatedly seen, little growth
takes place either among animals or plants at temperatures
below 0&deg;C. or above 40&deg;C., and for most species
the limiting temperatures are about 10&deg; and 30&deg;. The
maintenance of so narrow a scale of temperature is a
function of the atmosphere, as well as of the sun. Without
an atmosphere, the temperature by day would mount
fatally wherever the sun rides high in the sky. By night
it would fall everywhere to a temperature approaching
absolute zero, that is -273&deg;C. Some such temperature
prevails a few miles above the earth's surface,
beyond the effective atmosphere. Indeed, even if the
atmosphere were almost as it is now, but only lacked one
of the minor constituents, a constituent which is often
actually ignored in statements of the composition of the
air, life would be impossible. Tyndall concludes that if
water vapor were entirely removed from the atmosphere
for a single day and night, all life&mdash;except that which is
dormant in the form of seeds, eggs, or spores&mdash;would be
exterminated. Part would be killed by the high temperature
developed by day when the sun was high, and part,
by the cold night.</p>

<p>The testimony of ancient glaciation as to the slight
difference in the climate and therefore in the atmosphere
of early and late geological times is almost as clear
as that of life. Just as life proves that the earth can never
have been extremely cold during hundreds of millions of
years, so glaciation in moderately low latitudes near
<!--File: cc256.png Page 232-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_232" title="pg 232"></a>
the dawn of earth history and at several later times,
proves that the earth was not particularly hot even in
those early days. The gentle progressive change of climate
which is recorded in the rocks appears to have been only
in slight measure a change in the mean temperature of
the earth as a whole, and almost entirely a change in the
distribution of temperature from place to place and
season to season. Hence it seems probable that neither
the earth's own emission of heat, nor the supply of solar
heat, nor the power of the atmosphere to retain heat can
have been much greater a few hundred million years ago
than now. It is indeed possible that these three factors
may have varied in such a way that any variation in one
has been offset by variations of the others in the opposite
direction. This, however, is so highly improbable that it
seems advisable to assume that all three have remained
relatively constant. This conclusion together with a
realization of the climatic significance of carbon dioxide
has forced most of the adherents of the nebular hypothesis
to abandon their assumption that carbon dioxide, the
heaviest gas in the air, was very abundant until taken
out by coal-forming plants or combined with the calcium
oxide of igneous rocks to form the limestone secreted
by animals. In the same way the presence of sun cracks
in sedimentary rocks of all ages suggests that the air
cannot have contained vast quantities of water vapor
such as have been assumed by Knowlton and others in
order to account for the former lack of sharp climatic
contrast between the zones. Such a large amount of water
vapor would almost certainly be accompanied by well-nigh
universal and continual cloudiness so that there
would be little chance for the pools on the earth's water-soaked
surface to dry up. Furthermore, there is only one
way in which such cloudiness could be maintained and
<!--File: cc257.png Page 233-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_233" title="pg 233"></a>
that is by keeping the air at an almost constant temperature
night and day. This would require that the chief
source of warmth be the interior of the earth, a condition
which the Proterozoic, Permian, and other widespread
glaciations seem to disprove.</p>

<p>Thus there appears to be strong evidence against the
radical changes in the atmosphere which are sometimes
postulated. Yet some changes must have taken place, and
even minor changes would be accompanied by some sort
of climatic effect. The changes would take the form of
either an increase or a decrease in the atmosphere as a
whole, or in its constituent elements. The chief means by
which the atmosphere has increased appear to be as
follows: (a) By contributions from the interior of the
earth via volcanoes and springs and by the weathering of
igneous rocks with the consequent release of their enclosed
gases;<sup><a href="#fn108" id="r108">[108]</a></sup> (b) by the escape of some of the abundant
gases which the ocean holds in solution; (c) by the arrival
on the earth of gases from space, either enclosed in
meteors or as free-flying molecules; (d) by the release of
gases from organic compounds by oxidation, or by exhalation
from animals and plants. On the other hand, one
or another of the constituents of the atmosphere has presumably
decreased (a) by being locked up in newly
formed rocks or organic compounds; (b) by being dissolved
in the ocean; (c) by the escape of molecules into
space; and (d) by the condensation of water vapor.</p>

<p>The combined effect of the various means of increase
and decrease depends partly on the amount of each constituent
received from the earth's interior or from space,
and partly on the fact that the agencies which tend to
deplete the atmosphere are highly selective in their
<!--File: cc258.png Page 234-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_234" title="pg 234"></a>
action. Our knowledge of how large a quantity of new
gases the air has received is very scanty, but judging by
present conditions the general tendency is toward a slow
increase chiefly because of meteorites, volcanic action,
and the work of deep-seated springs. As to decrease, the
case is clearer. This is because the chemically active
gases, oxygen, CO<sub>2</sub>, and water vapor, tend to be locked
up in the rocks, while the chemically inert gases, nitrogen
and argon, show almost no such tendency. Though oxygen
is by far the most abundant element in the earth's
crust, making up more than 50 per cent of the total, it
forms only about one-fifth of the air. Nitrogen, on the
other hand, is very rare in the rocks, but makes up nearly
four-fifths of the air. It would, therefore, seem probable
that throughout the earth's history, there has been a
progressive increase in the amount of atmospheric nitrogen,
and presumably a somewhat corresponding increase
in the mass of the air. On the other hand, it is not clear
what changes have occurred in the amount of atmospheric
oxygen. It may have increased somewhat or
perhaps even notably. Nevertheless, because of the
greater increase in nitrogen, it may form no greater percentage
of the air now than in the distant past.</p>

<p>As to the absolute amounts of oxygen, Barrell<sup><a href="#fn109" id="r109">[109]</a></sup>
thought that atmospheric oxygen began to be present
only after plants had appeared. It will be recalled that
plants absorb carbon dioxide and separate the carbon
from the oxygen, using the carbon in their tissues and
setting free the oxygen. As evidence of a paucity of
oxygen in the air in early Proterozoic times, Barrell
cites the fact that the sedimentary rocks of that remote
<!--File: cc259.png Page 235-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_235" title="pg 235"></a>
time commonly are somewhat greyish or greenish-grey
wackes, or other types, indicating incomplete oxidation.
He admits, however, that the stupendous thicknesses of
red sandstones, quartzite, and hematitic iron ores of the
later Proterozoic prove that by that date there was an
abundance of atmospheric oxygen. If so, the change from
paucity to abundance must have occurred before fossils
were numerous enough to give much clue to climate.
However, Barrell's evidence as to a former paucity of
atmospheric oxygen is not altogether convincing. In the
first place, it does not seem justifiable to assume that
there could be no oxygen until plants appeared to break
down the carbon dioxide, for some oxygen is contributed
by volcanoes,<sup><a href="#fn110" id="r110">[110]</a></sup> and lightning decomposes water into its
elements. Part of the hydrogen thus set free escapes into
space, for the earth's gravitative force does not appear
great enough to hold this lightest of gases, but the oxygen
remains. Thus electrolysis of water results in the
accumulation of oxygen. In the second place, there is no
proof that the ancient greywackes are not deoxidized
sediments. Light colored rock formations do not necessarily
indicate a paucity of atmospheric oxygen, for such
rocks are abundant even in recent times. For example,
the Tertiary formations are characteristically light
colored, a result, however, of deoxidation. Finally, the
fact that sedimentary rocks, irrespective of their age,
contain an average of about 1.5 per cent more oxygen
than do igneous rocks,<sup><a href="#fn111" id="r111">[111]</a></sup> suggests that oxygen was present
in the air in quantity even when the earliest shales
and sandstones were formed, for atmospheric oxygen
seems to be the probable source of the extra oxygen they
<!--File: cc260.png Page 236-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_236" title="pg 236"></a>
contain. The formation of these particular sedimentary
rocks by weathering of igneous rocks involves only a
little carbon dioxide and water. Although it seems probable
that oxygen was present in the atmosphere even at
the beginning of the geological record, it may have been
far less abundant then than now. It may have been removed
from the atmosphere by animals or by the oxidation
of the rocks almost as rapidly as it was added by
volcanoes, plants, and other agencies.</p>

<p>After this chapter was in type, St. John<sup><a href="#fn112" id="r112">[112]</a></sup> announced
his interesting discovery that oxygen is apparently lacking
in the atmosphere of Venus. He considers that this
proves that Venus has no life. Furthermore he concludes
that so active an element as oxygen cannot be abundant
in the atmosphere of a planet unless plants continually
supply large quantities by breaking down carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>But even if the earth has experienced a notable increase
in atmospheric oxygen since the appearance of
life, this does not necessarily involve important climatic
changes except those due to increased atmospheric density.
This is because oxygen has very little effect upon
the passage of light or heat, being transparent to all but
a few wave lengths. Those absorbed are chiefly in the
ultra violet.</p>

<p>The distinct possibility that oxygen has increased in
amount, makes it the more likely that there has been an
increase in the total atmosphere, for the oxygen would
supplement the increase in the relatively inert nitrogen
and argon, which has presumably taken place. The climatic
effects of an increase in the atmosphere include, in
the first place, an increased scattering of light as it
approaches the earth. Nitrogen, argon, and oxygen all
<!--File: cc261.png Page 237-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_237" title="pg 237"></a>
scatter the short waves of light and thus interfere with
their reaching the earth. Abbot and Fowle,<sup><a href="#fn113" id="r113">[113]</a></sup> who have
carefully studied the matter, believe that at present the
scattering is quantitatively important in lessening insolation.
Hence our supposed general increase in the volume
of the air during part of geological times would tend to
reduce the amount of solar energy reaching the earth's
surface. On the other hand, nitrogen and argon do not
appear to absorb the long wave lengths known as heat,
and oxygen absorbs so little as to be almost a non-absorber.
Therefore the reduced penetration of the air
by solar radiation due to the scattering of light would
apparently not be neutralized by any direct increase in
the blanketing effect of the atmosphere, and the temperature
near the earth's surface would be slightly lowered
by a thicker atmosphere. This would diminish the amount
of water vapor which would be held in the air, and
thereby lower the temperature a trifle more.</p>

<p>In the second place, the higher atmospheric pressure
which would result from the addition of gases to the
air would cause a lessening of the rate of evaporation,
for that rate declines as pressure increases. Decreased
evaporation would presumably still further diminish the
vapor content of the atmosphere. This would mean a
greater daily and seasonal range of temperature, as is
very obvious when we compare clear weather with cloudy.
Cloudy nights are relatively warm while clear nights are
cool, because water vapor is an almost perfect absorber
of radiant heat, and there is enough of it in the air on
moist nights to interfere greatly with the escape of the
heat accumulated during the day. Therefore, if atmospheric
<!--File: cc262.png Page 238-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_238" title="pg 238"></a>
moisture were formerly much more abundant
than now, the temperature must have been much more
uniform. The tendency toward climatic severity as time
went on would be still further increased by the cooling
which would result from the increased wind velocity discussed
below; for cooling by convection increases with
the velocity of the wind, as does cooling by conduction.</p>

<p>Any persistent lowering of the general temperature of
the air would affect not only its ability to hold water
vapor, but would produce a lessening in the amount of
atmospheric carbon dioxide, for the colder the ocean
becomes the more carbon dioxide it can hold in solution.
When the oceanic temperature falls, part of the atmospheric
carbon dioxide is dissolved in the ocean. This
minor constituent of the air is important because
although it forms only 0.003 per cent of the earth's atmosphere,
Abbot and Fowle's<sup><a href="#fn114" id="r114">[114]</a></sup> calculations indicate that
it absorbs over 10 per cent of the heat radiated outward
from the earth. Hence variations in the amount of carbon
dioxide may have caused an appreciable variation in
temperature and thus in other climatic conditions.
Humphreys, as we have seen, has calculated that a
doubling of the carbon dioxide in the air would directly
raise the earth's temperature to the extent of 1.3&deg;C., and
a halving would lower it a like amount. The indirect
results of such an increase or decrease might be greater
than the direct results, for the change in temperature
due to variations in carbon dioxide would alter the
capacity of the air to hold moisture.</p>

<p>Two conditions would especially help in this respect;
first, changes in nocturnal cooling, and second, changes
in local convection. The presence of carbon dioxide diminishes
nocturnal cooling because it absorbs the heat radiated
<!--File: cc263.png Page 239-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_239" title="pg 239"></a>
by the earth, and re-radiates part of it back again.
Hence with increased carbon dioxide and with the
consequent warmer nights there would be less nocturnal
condensation of water vapor to form dew and frost.
Local convection is influenced by carbon dioxide because
this gas lessens the temperature gradient. In general, the
less the gradient, that is, the less the contrast between
the temperature at the surface and higher up, the less
convection takes place. This is illustrated by the seasonal
variation in convection. In summer, when the gradient is
steepest, convection reaches its maximum. It will be recalled
that when air rises it is cooled by expansion, and
if it ascends far the moisture is soon condensed and
precipitated. Indeed, local convection is considered by
C. P. Day to be the chief agency which keeps the lower
air from being continually saturated with moisture. The
presence of carbon dioxide lessens convection because it
increases the absorption of heat in the zone above the
level in which water vapor is abundant, thus warming
these higher layers. The lower air may not be warmed
correspondingly by an increase in carbon dioxide if
Abbot and Fowle are right in stating that near the earth's
surface there is enough water vapor to absorb practically
all the wave lengths which carbon dioxide is capable of
absorbing. Hence carbon dioxide is chiefly effective at
heights to which the low temperature prevents water
vapor from ascending. Carbon dioxide is also effective
in cold winters and in high latitudes when even the lower
air is too cold to contain much water vapor. Moreover,
carbon dioxide, by altering the amount of atmospheric
water vapor, exerts an indirect as well as a direct effect
upon temperature.</p>

<p>Other effects of the increase in air pressure which we
are here assuming during at least the early part of geological
<!--File: cc264.png Page 240-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_240" title="pg 240"></a>
times are corresponding changes in barometric
contrasts, in the strength of winds, and in the mass of air
carried by the winds along the earth's surface. The increase
in the mass of the air would re&euml;nforce the greater
velocity of the winds in their action as eroding and transporting
agencies. Because of the greater weight of the
air, the winds would be capable of picking up more dust
and of carrying it farther and higher; while the increased
atmospheric friction would keep it aloft a longer time.
The significance of dust at high levels and its relation to
solar radiation have already been discussed in connection
with volcanoes. It will be recalled that on the average it
lowers the surface temperature. At lower levels, since
dust absorbs heat quickly and gives it out quickly, its
presence raises the temperature of the air by day and
lowers it by night. Hence an increase in dustiness tends
toward greater extremes.</p>

<p>From all these considerations it appears that if the
atmosphere has actually evolved according to the supposition
which is here tentatively entertained, the general
tendency of the resultant climatic changes must have
been partly toward long geological oscillations and partly
toward a general though very slight increase in climatic
severity and in the contrasts between the zones. This
seems to agree with the geological record, although the
fact that we are living in an age of relative climatic
severity may lead us astray.</p>

<p>The significant fact about the whole matter is that the
three great types of terrestrial agencies, namely, those
of the earth's interior, those of the oceans, and those of
the air, all seem to have suffered changes which lead to
slow variations of climate. Many reversals have doubtless
taken place, and the geologic oscillations thus induced
are presumably of much greater importance than
<!--File: cc265.png Page 241-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_241" title="pg 241"></a>
the progressive change, yet so far as we can tell the
purely terrestrial changes throughout the hundreds of
millions of years of geological time have tended toward
complexity and toward increased contrasts from continent
to ocean, from latitude to latitude, from season to
season, and from day to night.</p>

<p>Throughout geological history the slow and almost
imperceptible differentiation of the earth's surface has
been one of the most noteworthy of all changes. It has
been opposed by the extraordinary conservatism of the
universe which causes the average temperature today to
be so like that of hundreds of millions of years ago that
many types of life are almost identical. Nevertheless, the
differentiation has gone on. Often, to be sure, it has presumably
been completely masked by the disturbances of
the solar atmosphere which appear to have been the
cause of the sharper, shorter climatic pulsations. But
regardless of cosmic conservatism and of solar impulses
toward change, the slow differentiation of the earth's
surface has apparently given to the world of today much
of the geographical complexity which is so stimulating
a factor in organic evolution. Such complexity&mdash;such
diversity from place to place&mdash;appears to be largely
accounted for by purely terrestrial causes. It may be
regarded as the great terrestrial contribution to the
climatic environment which guides the development of
life.</p>

<h3>THE EFFECT OF OTHER BODIES ON THE SUN</h3>


<p>If solar activity is really an important factor in
causing climatic changes, it behooves us to subject
the sun to the same kind of inquiry to which we
have subjected the earth. We have inquired into the nature
of the changes through which the earth's crust, the
oceans, and the atmosphere have influenced the climate
of geological times. It has not been necessary, however,
to study the origin of the earth, nor to trace its earlier
stages. Our study of the geological record begins only
when the earth had attained practically its present mass,
essentially its present shape, and a climate so similar to
that of today that life as we know it was possible. In
other words, the earth had passed the stages of infancy,
childhood, youth, and early maturity, and had reached
full maturity. As it still seems to be indefinitely far from
old age, we infer that during geological times its relative
changes have been no greater than those which a man
experiences between the ages of perhaps twenty-five and
forty.</p>

<p>Similar reasoning applies with equal or greater force
to the sun. Because of its vast size it presumably passes
through its stages of development much more slowly than
the earth. In the first chapter of this book we saw that
the earth's relative uniformity of climate for hundreds of
millions of years seems to imply a similar uniformity in
solar activity. This accords with a recent tendency among
<!--File: cc267.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_243" title="pg 243"></a>
astronomers who are more and more recognizing that the
stars and the solar system possess an extraordinary degree
of conservatism. Changes that once were supposed
to take place in thousands of years are now thought to
have required millions. Hence in this chapter we shall
assume that throughout geological times the condition
of the sun has been almost as at present. It may have
been somewhat larger, or different in other ways, but it
was essentially a hot, gaseous body such as we see today
and it gave out essentially the same amount of energy.
This assumption will affect the general validity of what
follows only if it departs widely from the truth. With this
assumption, then, let us inquire into the degree to which
the sun's atmosphere has probably been disturbed
throughout geological times.</p>

<p>In <em>Earth and Sun</em>, as already explained, a detailed
study has led to the conclusion that cyclonic storms are
influenced by the electrical action of the sun. Such action
appears to be most intense in sunspots, but apparently
pertains also to other disturbed areas in the sun's
atmosphere. A study of sunspots suggests that their
true periodicity is almost if not exactly identical with
that of the orbital revolution of Jupiter, 11.8 years. Other
investigations show numerous remarkable coincidences
between sunspots and the orbital revolution of the other
planets, including especially Saturn and Mercury. This
seems to indicate that there is some truth in the hypothesis
that sunspots and other related disturbances of the
solar atmosphere owe their periodicity to the varying
effects of the planets as they approach and recede from
the sun in their eccentric orbits and as they combine or
oppose their effects according to their relative positions.
This does not mean that the energy of the solar disturbances
is supposed to come from the planets, but merely
<!--File: cc268.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_244" title="pg 244"></a>
that their variations act like the turning of a switch to
determine when and how violently the internal forces of
the sun shall throw the solar atmosphere into commotion.
This hypothesis is by no means new, for in one form or
another it has been advocated by Wolfer, Birkeland,
E. W. Brown, Schuster, Arctowski, and others.</p>

<p>The agency through which the planets influence the
solar atmosphere is not yet clear. The suggested agencies
are the direct pull of gravitation, the tidal effect of the
planets, and an electro-magnetic effect. In <em>Earth and
Sun</em> the conclusion is reached that the first two are out
of the question, a conclusion in which E. W. Brown
acquiesces. Unless some unknown cause is appealed to,
this leaves an electro-magnetic hypothesis as the only one
which has a reasonable foundation. Schuster inclines to
this view. The conclusions set forth in <em>Earth and Sun</em> as
to the electrical nature of the sun's influence on the earth
point somewhat in the same direction. Hence in this
chapter we shall inquire what would happen to the sun,
and hence to the earth, on their journey through space,
if the solar atmosphere is actually subject to disturbance
by the electrical or other effects of other heavenly bodies.
It need hardly be pointed out that we are here venturing
into highly speculative ground, and that the verity or
falsity of the conclusions reached in this chapter has
nothing to do with the validity of the reasoning in previous
chapters. Those chapters are based on the assumption
that terrestrial causes of climatic changes are supplemented
by solar disturbances which produce their
effect partly through variations in temperature but also
through variations in the intensity and paths of cyclonic
storms. The present chapter seeks to shed some light on
the possible causes and sequence of solar disturbances.</p>

<p>Let us begin by scanning the available evidence as to
<!--File: cc269.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_245" title="pg 245"></a>
solar disturbances previous to the time when accurate
sunspot records are available. Two rather slender bits of
evidence point to cycles of solar activity lasting hundreds
of years. One of these has already been discussed in
Chapter VI, where the climatic stress of the fourteenth
century was described. At that time sunspots are known
to have been unusually numerous, and there were great
climatic extremes. Lakes overflowed in Central Asia;
storms, droughts, floods, and cold winters were unusually
severe in Europe; the Caspian Sea rose with great
rapidity; the trees of California grew with a vigor unknown
for centuries; the most terrible of recorded famines
occurred in England and India; the Eskimos were
probably driven south by increasing snowiness in Greenland;
and the Mayas of Yucatan appear to have made
their last weak attempt at a revival of civilization under
the stimulus of greater storminess and less constant
rainfall.</p>

<p>The second bit of evidence is found in recent exhaustive
studies of periodicities by Turner<sup><a href="#fn115" id="r115">[115]</a></sup> and other
astronomers. They have sought every possible natural
occurrence for which a numerical record is available for
a long period. The most valuable records appear to be
those of tree growth, Nile floods, Chinese earthquakes,
and sunspots. Turner reaches the conclusion that all four
types of phenomena show the same periodicity, namely,
cycles with an average length of about 260 to 280 years.
He suggests that if this is true, the cycles in tree growth
and in floods, both of which are climatic, are probably
due to a non-terrestrial cause. The fact that the sunspots
<!--File: cc270.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_246" title="pg 246"></a>
show similar cycles suggests that the sun's variations
are the cause.</p>

<p>These two bits of evidence are far too slight to form
the foundation of any theory as to changes in solar
activity in the geological past. Nevertheless it may be
helpful to set forth certain possibilities as a stimulus to
further research. For example, it has been suggested that
meteoric bodies may have fallen into the sun and caused
it suddenly to flare up, as it were. This is not impossible,
although it does not appear to have taken place since
men became advanced enough to make careful observations.
Moreover, the meteorites which now fall on the
earth are extremely small, the average size being computed
as no larger than a grain of wheat. The largest
ever found on the earth's surface, at Bacubirito in
Mexico, weighs only about fifty tons, while within the
rocks the evidences of meteorites are extremely scanty
and insignificant. If meteorites had fallen into the sun
often enough and of sufficient size to cause glacial fluctuations
and historic pulsations of climate, it seems highly
probable that the earth would show much more evidence
of having been similarly disturbed. And even if the sun
should be bombarded by large meteors the result would
probably not be sudden cold periods, which are the most
notable phenomena of the earth's climatic history, but
sudden warm periods followed by slow cooling. Nevertheless,
the disturbance of the sun by collision with meteoric
matter can by no means be excluded as a possible cause
of climatic variations.</p>

<p>Allied to the preceding hypothesis is Shapley's<sup><a href="#fn116" id="r116">[116]</a></sup> nebular
hypothesis. At frequent intervals, averaging about
<!--File: cc271.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_247" title="pg 247"></a>
once a year during the last thirty years, astronomers have
discovered what are known as nov&aelig;. These are stars
which were previously faint or even invisible, but which
flash suddenly into brilliancy. Often their light-giving
power rises seven or eight magnitudes&mdash;a thousand-fold.
In addition to the spectacular nov&aelig; there are numerous
irregular variables whose brilliancy changes in every
ratio from a few per cent up to several magnitudes. Most
of them are located in the vicinity of nebul&aelig;, as is also
the case with nov&aelig;. This, as well as other facts, makes it
probable that all these stars are "friction variables," as
Shapley calls them. Apparently as they pass through the
nebul&aelig; they come in contact with its highly diffuse
matter and thereby become bright much as the earth
would become bright if its atmosphere were filled with
millions of almost infinitesimally small meteorites. A star
may also lose brilliancy if nebulous matter intervenes
between it and the observer. If our sun has been subjected
to any of these changes some sort of climatic effect
must have been produced.</p>

<p>In a personal communication Shapley amplifies the
nebular climatic hypothesis as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within 700 light years of the sun in many directions (Taurus,
Cygnus, Ophiuchus, Scorpio) are great diffuse clouds of nebulosity,
some bright, most of them dark. The probability that stars
moving in the general region of such clouds will encounter this
material is very high, for the clouds fill enormous volumes of
space,&mdash;e.g., probably more than a hundred thousand cubic light
years in the Orion region, and are presumably composed of rarefied
gases or of dust particles. Probably throughout all our
part of space such nebulosity exists (it is all around us, we are
sure), but only in certain regions is it dense enough to affect
conspicuously the stars involved in it. If a star moving at high
velocity should collide with a dense part of such a nebulous
<!--File: cc272.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_248" title="pg 248"></a>
cloud, we should probably have a typical nova. If the relative
velocity of nebulous material and star were low or moderate, or
if the material were rare, we should not expect a conspicuous
effect on the star's light.</p>

<p>In the nebulous region of Orion, which is probably of unusually
high density, there are about 100 known stars, varying
between 20% and 80% of their total light&mdash;all of them irregularly&mdash;some
slowly, some suddenly. Apparently they are
"friction variables." Some of the variables suddenly lose 40%
of their light as if blanketed by nebulous matter. In the Trifid
Nebula there are variables like those of Orion, in Messier 8 also,
and probably many of the 100 or so around the Rho Ophiuchi
region belong to this kind.</p>

<p>I believe that our sun could not have been a typical nova, at
least not since the Archeozoic, that is for perhaps a billion years.
I believe we have in geological climates final proof of this, because
an increase in the amount of solar radiation by 1000 times
as in the typical nova, would certainly punctuate emphatically
the life cycle on the earth, even if the cause of the nova would
not at the same time eliminate the smaller planets. But the sun
may have been one of these miniature nov&aelig; or friction variables;
and I believe it very probable that its wanderings through
this part of space could not long leave its mean temperature
unaffected to the amount of a few per cent.</p>

<p>One reason we have not had this proposal insisted upon
before is that the data back of it are mostly new&mdash;the Orion
variables have been only recently discovered and studied, the
distribution and content of the dark nebul&aelig; are hardly as yet
generally known.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This interesting hypothesis cannot be hastily dismissed.
If the sun should pass through a nebula it seems
inevitable that there would be at least slight climatic
effects and perhaps catastrophic effects through the
action of the gaseous matter not only on the sun but on
the earth's own atmosphere. As an explanation of the
<!--File: cc273.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_249" title="pg 249"></a>
general climatic conditions of the past, however, Shapley
points out that the hypothesis has the objection of being
vague, and that nebulosity should not be regarded as
more than "a possible factor." One of the chief difficulties
seems to be the enormously wide distribution of as
yet undiscovered nebulous matter which must be assumed
if any large share of the earth's repeated climatic
changes is to be ascribed to such matter. If such matter
is actually abundant in space, it is hard to see how any
but the nearest stars would be visible. Another objection
is that there is no known nebulosity near at hand with
which to connect the climatic vicissitudes of the last
glacial period. Moreover, the known nebul&aelig; are so much
less numerous than stars that the chances that the sun
will encounter one of them are extremely slight. This,
however, is not an objection, for Shapley points out that
during geological times the sun can never have varied
as much as do the nov&aelig;, or even as most of the friction
variables. Thus the hypothesis stands as one that is worth
investigating, but that cannot be finally rejected or accepted
until it is made more definite and until more information
is available.</p>

<p>Another suggested cause of solar variations is the relatively
sudden contraction of the sun such as that which
sometimes occurs on the earth when continents are uplifted
and mountains upheaved. It seems improbable that
this could have occurred in a gaseous body like the sun.
Lacking, as it does, any solid crust which resists a change
of form, the sun probably shrinks steadily. Hence any
climatic effects thus produced must be extremely gradual
and must tend steadily in one direction for millions of
years.</p>

<p>Still another suggestion is that the tidal action of the
stars and other bodies which may chance to approach
<!--File: cc274.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_250" title="pg 250"></a>
the sun's path may cause disturbances of the solar
atmosphere. The vast kaleidoscope of space is never
quiet. The sun, the stars, and all the other heavenly
bodies are moving, often with enormous speed. Hence the
effect of gravitation upon the sun must vary constantly
and irregularly, as befits the geological requirements. In
the case of the planets, however, the tidal effect does not
seem competent to produce the movements of the solar
atmosphere which appear to be concerned in the inception
of sunspots. Moreover, there is only the most remote
probability that a star and the sun will approach near
enough to one another to produce a pronounced gravitational
disturbance in the solar atmosphere. For instance,
if it be assumed that changes in Jupiter's tidal effect on
the sun are the main factor in regulating the present difference
between sunspot maxima and sunspot minima,
the chances that a star or some non-luminous body of
similar mass will approach near enough to stimulate
solar activity and thereby bring on glaciation are only
one in twelve billion years, as will be explained below.
This seems to make a gravitational hypothesis impossible.</p>

<p>Another possible cause of solar disturbances is that
the stars in their flight through space may exert an
electrical influence which upsets the equilibrium of the
solar atmosphere. At first thought this seems even more
impossible than a gravitational effect. Electrostatic
effects, however, differ greatly from those of tides. They
vary as the diameter of a body instead of as its mass;
their differentials also vary inversely as the square of
the distance instead of as the cube. Electrostatic effects
also increase as the fourth power of the temperature or
at least would do so if they followed the law of black
bodies; they are stimulated by the approach of one body
<!--File: cc275.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_251" title="pg 251"></a>
to another; and they are cumulative, for if ions arrive
from space they must accumulate until the body to which
they have come begins to discharge them. Hence, on the
basis of assumptions such as those used in the preceding
paragraph, the chances of an electrical disturbance of
the solar atmosphere sufficient to cause glaciation on the
earth may be as high as one in twenty or thirty million
years. This seems to put an electrical hypothesis within
the bounds of possibility. Further than that we cannot
now go. There may be other hypotheses which fit the facts
much better, but none seems yet to have been suggested.</p>

<p>In the rest of this chapter the tidal and electrical
hypotheses of stellar action on the sun will be taken up
in detail. The tidal hypothesis is considered because in
discussions of the effect of the planets it has hitherto
held almost the entire field. The electrical hypothesis will
be considered because it appears to be the best yet suggested,
although it still seems doubtful whether electrical
effects can be of appreciable importance over such vast
distances as are inevitably involved. The discussion of
both hypotheses will necessarily be somewhat technical,
and will appeal to the astronomer more than to the layman.
It does not form a necessary part of this book, for
it has no bearing on our main thesis of the effect of the
sun on the earth. It is given here because ultimately the
question of changes in solar activity during geological
times must be faced.</p>

<p>In the astronomical portion of the following discussion
we shall follow Jeans<sup><a href="#fn117" id="r117">[117]</a></sup> in his admirable attempt at a
mathematical analysis of the motions of the universe.
Jeans divides the heavenly bodies into five main types.
(1) Spiral nebul&aelig;, which are thought by some astronomers
<!--File: cc276.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_252" title="pg 252"></a>
to be systems like our own in the making, and by
others to be independent universes lying at vast distances
beyond the limits of our Galactic universe, as it is called
from the Galaxy or Milky Way. (2) Nebul&aelig; of a smaller
type, called planetary. These lie within the Galactic portion
of the universe and seem to be early stages of what
may some day be stars or solar systems. (3) Binary or
multiple stars, which are extraordinarily numerous. In
some parts of the heavens they form 50 or even 60 per
cent of the stars and in the galaxy as a whole they seem to
form "fully one third." (4) Star clusters. These consist
of about a hundred groups of stars in each of which the
stars move together in the same direction with approximately
the same velocity. These, like the spiral nebul&aelig;,
are thought by some astronomers to lie outside the limits
of the galaxy, but this is far from certain. (5) The solar
system. According to Jeans this seems to be unique. It
does not fit into the general mathematical theory by
which he explains spiral nebul&aelig;, planetary nebul&aelig;, binary
stars, and star clusters. It seems to demand a special
explanation, such as is furnished by tidal disruption due
to the passage of the sun close to another star.</p>

<p>The part of Jeans' work which specially concerns us is
his study of the probability that some other star will
approach the sun closely enough to have an appreciable
gravitative or electrical effect, and thus cause disturbances
in the solar atmosphere. Of course both the star
and the sun are moving, but to avoid circumlocution we
shall speak of such mutual approaches simply as approaches
of the sun. For our present purpose the most
fundamental fact may be summed up in a quotation from
Jeans in which he says that most stars "show evidence
of having experienced considerable disturbance by other
systems; there is no reason why our solar system should
<!--File: cc277.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_253" title="pg 253"></a>
be expected to have escaped the common fate." Jeans
gives a careful calculation from which it is possible to
derive some idea of the probability of any given degree of
approach of the sun and some other star. Of course all
such calculations must be based on certain assumptions.
The assumptions made by Jeans are such as to make the
probability of close approaches as great as possible. For
example, he allows only 560 million years for the entire
evolution of the sun, whereas some astronomers and
geologists would put the figure ten or more times as
high. Nevertheless, Jeans' assumptions at least show
the order of magnitude which we may expect on the basis
of reasonable astronomical conclusions.</p>

<p>According to the planetary hypothesis of sunspots, the
difference in the effect of Jupiter when it is nearest and
farthest from the sun is the main factor in starting the
sunspot cycle and hence the corresponding terrestrial
cycle. The climatic difference between sunspot maxima
and minima, as measured by temperature, apparently
amounts to at least a twentieth and perhaps a tenth of
the difference between the climate of the last glacial
epoch and the present. We may suppose, then, that a body
which introduced a gravitative or electrical factor twenty
times as great as the difference in Jupiter's effect at its
maximum and minimum distances from the sun would
cause a glacial epoch if the effect lasted long enough. Of
course the other planets combine their effects with that
of Jupiter, but for the sake of simplicity we will leave
the others out of account. The difference between Jupiter's
maximum and minimum tidal effect on the sun
amounts to 29 per cent of the planet's average effect.
The corresponding difference, according to the electrical
hypothesis, is about 19 per cent, for electrostatic action
varies as the square of the distance instead of as the cube.
<!--File: cc278.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_254" title="pg 254"></a>
Let us assume that a body exerting four times Jupiter's
present tidal effect and placed at the average distance of
Jupiter from the sun would disturb the sun's atmosphere
twenty times as much as the present difference between
sunspot maxima and minima, and thus, perhaps, cause a
glacial period on the earth.</p>

<p>On the basis of this assumption our first problem is to
estimate the frequency with which a star, visible or
dark, is likely to approach near enough to the sun to
produce a <em>tidal</em> effect four times that of Jupiter. The
number of visible stars is known or at least well estimated.
As to dark stars, which have grown cool, Arrhenius
believed that they are a hundred times as numerous
as bright stars; few astronomers believe that there are
less than three or four times as many. Dr. Shapley of
the Harvard Observatory states that a new investigation
of the matter suggests that eight or ten is probably a
maximum figure. Let us assume that nine is correct.
The average visible star, so far as measured, has a mass
about twice that of the sun, or about 2100 times that of
Jupiter. The distances of the stars have been measured
in hundreds of cases and thus we can estimate how many
stars, both visible and invisible, are on an average contained
in a given volume of space. On this basis Jeans
estimates that there is only one chance in thirty billion
years that a visible star will approach within 2.8 times
the distance of Neptune from the sun, that is, within about
eight billion miles. If we include the invisible stars the
chances become one in three billion years. In order to
produce four times the tidal effect of Jupiter, however,
the average star would have to approach within about
four billion miles of the sun, and the chances of that
are only one in twelve billion years. The disturbing star
<!--File: cc279.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_255" title="pg 255"></a>
would be only 40 per cent farther from the sun than
Neptune, and would almost pass within the solar system.</p>

<p>Even though Jeans holds that the frequency of the
mutual approach of the sun and a star was probably
much greater in the distant past than at present, the
figures just given lend little support to the tidal hypothesis.
In fact, they apparently throw it out of court. It will
be remembered that Jeans has made assumptions which
give as high a frequency of stellar encounters as is consistent
with the astronomical facts. We have assumed
nine dark stars for every bright one, which may be a
liberal estimate. Also, although we have assumed that a
disturbance of the sun's atmosphere sufficient to cause
a glacial period would arise from a tidal effect only
twenty times as great as the difference in Jupiter's effect
when nearest the sun and farthest away, in our computations
this has actually been reduced to thirteen. With all
these favorable assumptions the chances of a stellar approach
of the sort here described are now only one in
twelve billion years. Yet within a hundred million years,
according to many estimates of geological time, and
almost certainly within a billion, there have been at least
half a dozen glaciations.</p>

<p>Our use of Jeans' data interposes another and equally
insuperable difficulty to any tidal hypothesis. Four billion
miles is a very short distance in the eyes of an
astronomer. At that distance a star twice the size of the
sun would attract the outer planets more strongly than
the sun itself, and might capture them. If a star should
come within four billion miles of the sun, its effect in
distorting the orbits of all the planets would be great.
If this had happened often enough to cause all the glaciations
known to geologists, the planetary orbits would
be strongly elliptical instead of almost circular. The considerations
<!--File: cc280.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_256" title="pg 256"></a>
here advanced militate so strongly against
the tidal hypothesis of solar disturbances that it seems
scarcely worth while to consider it further.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to the electrical hypothesis. Here the
conditions are fundamentally different from those of the
tidal hypothesis. In the first place the electrostatic effect
of a body has nothing to do with its mass, but depends on
the area of its surface; that is, it varies as the square of
the radius. Second, the emission of electrons varies exponentially.
If hot glowing stars follow the same law as
black bodies at lower temperatures, the emission of
electrons, like the emission of other kinds of energy,
varies as the fourth power of the absolute temperature.
In other words, suppose there are two black bodies, otherwise
alike, but one with a temperature of 27&deg; C. or 300&deg;
on the absolute scale, and the other with 600&deg; on the
absolute scale. The temperature of one is twice as high
as that of the other, but the electrostatic effect will be
sixteen times as great.<sup><a href="#fn118" id="r118">[118]</a></sup> Third, the number of electrons
<!--File: cc281.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_257" title="pg 257"></a>
that reach a given body varies inversely as the square of
the distance, instead of as the cube which is the case
with tide-making forces.</p>

<p>In order to use these three principles in calculating
the effect of the stars we must know the diameters, distances,
temperature, and number of the stars. The distances
and number may safely be taken as given by Jeans
in the calculations already cited. As to the diameters, the
measurements of the stars thus far made indicate that
the average mass is about twice that of the sun. The
average density, as deduced by Shapley<sup><a href="#fn119" id="r119">[119]</a></sup> from the movements
of double stars, is about one-eighth the solar
density. This would give an average diameter about two
and a half times that of the sun. For the dark stars, we
shall assume for convenience that they are ten times as
numerous as the bright ones. We shall also assume that
their diameter is half that of the sun, for being cool they
must be relatively dense, and that their temperature is
the same as that which we shall assume for Jupiter.</p>

<p>As to Jupiter we shall continue our former assumption
that a body with four times the effectiveness of that
planet, which here means with twice as great a radius,
would disturb the sun enough to cause glaciation. It
would produce about twenty times the electrostatic effect
<!--File: cc282.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_258" title="pg 258"></a>
which now appears to be associated with the difference in
Jupiter's effect at maximum and minimum. The temperature
of Jupiter must also be taken into account. The
planet is supposed to be hot because its density is low,
being only about 1.25 that of water. Nevertheless, it is
probably not luminous, for as Moulton<sup><a href="#fn120" id="r120">[120]</a></sup> puts it, shadows
upon it are black and its moons show no sign of illumination
except from the sun. Hence a temperature of about
600&deg;C., or approximately 900&deg; on the absolute scale,
seems to be the highest that can reasonably be assigned
to the cold outer layer whence electrons are emitted. As
to the temperature of the sun, we shall adopt the common
estimate of about 6300&deg;C. on the absolute scale. The
other stars will be taken as averaging the same, although
of course they vary greatly.</p>

<p>When Jeans' method of calculating the probability of
a mutual approach of the sun and a star is applied to the
assumptions given above, the results are as shown in
Table 5. On that basis the dark stars seem to be of
negligible importance so far as the electrical hypothesis
is concerned. Even though they may be ten times as
numerous as the bright ones there appears to be only
one chance in 130 billion years that one of them will approach
the sun closely enough to cause the assumed disturbance
of the solar atmosphere. On the other hand, if
all the visible stars were the size of the sun, and as hot
as that body, their electrical effect would be fourfold
that of our assumed dark star because of their size, and
2401 times as great because of their temperature, or approximately
10,000 times as great. Under such conditions
the theoretical chance of an approach that would cause
glaciation is one in 130 million years. If the average
visible star is somewhat cooler than the sun and has a
<!--File: cc283.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_259" title="pg 259"></a>
radius about two and one-half times as great, as appears
to be the fact, the chances rise to one in thirty-eight million
years. A slight and wholly reasonable change in our
assumptions would reduce this last figure to only five or
ten million. For instance, the earth's mean temperature
during the glacial period has been assumed as 10&deg;C.
lower than now, but the difference may have been only 6&deg;.
Again, the temperature of the outer atmosphere of Jupiter
where the electrons are shot out may be only 500&deg; or
700&deg; absolute, instead of 900&deg;. Or the diameter of the
average star may be five or ten times that of the sun,
instead of only two and one-half times as great. All this,
however, may for the present be disregarded. The essential
point is that even when the assumptions err on the
side of conservatism, the results are of an order of magnitude
which puts the electrical hypothesis within the
bounds of possibility, whereas similar assumptions put
the tidal hypothesis, with its single approach in twelve
billion years, far beyond those limits.</p>

<p>The figures for Betelgeuse in Table 5 are interesting.
At a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science in December, 1920, Michelson
reported that by measurements of the interference of
light coming from the two sides of that bright star in
Orion, the observers at Mount Wilson had confirmed the
recent estimates of three other authorities that the star's
diameter is about 218 million miles, or 250 times that of
the sun. If other stars so much surpass the estimates of
only a decade or two ago, the average diameter of all the
visible stars must be many times that of the sun. The low
figure for Betelgeuse in section D of the table means that
if all the stars were as large as Betelgeuse, several might
often be near enough to cause profound disturbances of
the solar atmosphere. Nevertheless, because of the low
<!--File: cc284.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_260" title="pg 260"></a>
temperature of the giant red stars of the Betelgeuse type,
the distance at which one of them would produce a given
electrical effect is only about five times the distance at
which our assumed average star would produce the same
effect. This, to be sure, is on the assumption that the
<!--File: cc285.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_261" title="pg 261"></a>
radiation of energy from incandescent bodies varies
according to temperature in the same ratio as the radiation
from black bodies. Even if this assumption departs
somewhat from the truth, it still seems almost certain
that the lower temperature of the red compared with the
high temperature of the white stars must to a considerable
degree reduce the difference in electrical effect which
would otherwise arise from their size.</p>

<p>Thus far in our attempt to estimate the distance at
which a star might disturb the sun enough to cause glaciation
on the earth, we have considered only the star's
size and temperature. No account has been taken of the
degree to which its atmosphere is disturbed. Yet in the
case of the sun this seems to be one of the most important
factors. The magnetic field of sunspots is sometimes 50
or 100 times as strong as that of the sun in general. The
strength of the magnetic field appears to depend on the
strength of the electrical currents in the solar atmosphere.
But the intensity of the sunspots and, by inference,
of the electrical currents, may depend on the electrical
action of Jupiter and the other planets. If we apply a
similar line of reasoning to the stars, we are at once led
to question whether the electrical activity of double stars
may not be enormously greater than that of isolated
stars like the sun.</p>

<p>If this line of reasoning is correct, the atmosphere of
every double star must be in a state of commotion vastly
greater than that of the sun's atmosphere even when it
is most disturbed. For example, suppose the sun were
accompanied by a companion of equal size at a distance
of one million miles, which would make it much like many
known double stars. Suppose also that in accordance with
the general laws of physics the electrical effect of the
two suns upon one another is proportional to the fourth
<!--File: cc286.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_262" title="pg 262"></a>
power of the temperature, the square of the radius, and
the inverse square of the distance. Then the effect of each
sun upon the other would be sixty billion (6 &times; 10<sup>10</sup>) times
as great as the present electrical effect of Jupiter upon
the sun. Just what this would mean as to the net effect
of a pair of such suns upon the electrical potential of
other bodies at a distance we can only conjecture. The
outstanding fact is that the electrical conditions of a
double star must be radically different and vastly more
intense than those of a single star like the sun.</p>

<p>This conclusion carries weighty consequences. At present
twenty or more stars are known to be located within
about 100 trillion miles of the sun (five parsecs, as the
astronomers say), or 16.5 light years. According to the
assumptions employed in Table 5 an average single star
would influence the sun enough to cause glaciation if it
came within approximately 200 billion miles. If the star
were double, however, it might have an electrical capacity
enormously greater than that of the sun. Then it would
be able to cause glaciation at a correspondingly great
distance. Today Alpha Centauri, the nearest known star
about twenty-five trillion miles, or 4.3 light years from
the sun, and Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens, is
about fifty trillion miles away, or 8.5 light years. If these
stars were single and had a diameter three times that of
the sun, and if they were of the same temperature as has
been assumed for Betelgeuse, which is about fifty times as
far away as Alpha Centauri, the relative effects of the
three stars upon the sun would be, approximately, Betelgeuse
700, Alpha Centauri 250, Sirius 1. But Alpha Centauri
is triple and Sirius double, and both are much hotter
than Betelgeuse. Hence Alpha Centauri and even Sirius
may be far more effective than Betelgeuse.</p>

<p>The two main components of Alpha Centauri are separated
<!--File: cc287.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_263" title="pg 263"></a>
by an average distance of about 2,200,000,000 miles,
or somewhat less than that of Neptune from the sun. A
third and far fainter star, one of the faintest yet measured,
revolves around them at a great distance. In mass
and brightness the two main components are about like
the sun, and we will assume that the same is true of their
radius. Then, according to the assumptions made above,
their effect in disturbing one another electrically would
be about 10,000 times the total effect of Jupiter upon the
sun, or 2500 times the effect that we have assumed to be
necessary to produce a glacial period. We have already
seen in Table 5 that, according to our assumptions, a
single star like the sun would have to approach within
120 billion miles of the solar system, or within 2 per cent
of a light year, in order to cause glaciation. By a similar
process of reasoning it appears that if the mutual electrical
excitation of the two main parts of Alpha Centauri,
regardless of the third part, is proportional to the apparent
excitation of the sun by Jupiter, Alpha Centauri
would be 5000 times as effective as the sun. In other
words, if it came within 8,500,000,000,000 miles of the sun,
or 1.4 light years, it would so change the electrical conditions
as to produce a glacial epoch. In that case Alpha
Centauri is now so near that it introduces a disturbing
effect equal to about one-sixth of the effect needed to
cause glaciation on the earth. Sirius and perhaps others
of the nearer and brighter or larger stars may also create
appreciable disturbances in the electrical condition of the
sun's atmosphere, and may have done so to a much
greater degree in the past, or be destined to do so in the
future. Thus an electrical hypothesis of solar disturbances
seems to indicate that the position of the sun in
respect to other stars may be a factor of great importance
in determining the earth's climate.</p>

<h3>THE SUN'S JOURNEY THROUGH SPACE</h3>


<p>Having gained some idea of the nature of the
electrical hypothesis of solar disturbances and
of the possible effect of other bodies upon the
sun's atmosphere, let us now compare the astronomical
data with those of geology. Let us take up five chief
points for which the geologist demands an explanation,
and which any hypothesis must meet if it is to be permanently
accepted. These are (1) the irregular intervals
at which glacial periods occur; (2) the division of glacial
periods into epochs separated sometimes by hundreds
of thousands of years; (3) the length of glacial periods
and epochs; (4) the occurrence of glacial stages and historic
pulsations in the form of small climatic waves
superposed upon the larger waves of glacial epochs; (5)
the occurrence of climatic conditions much milder than
those of today, not only in the middle portion of the great
geological eras, but even in some of the recent inter-glacial
epochs.</p>

<p>1. The irregular duration of the interval from one
glacial epoch to another corresponds with the irregular
distribution of the stars. If glaciation is indirectly due
to stellar influences, the epochs might fall close together,
or might be far apart. If the average interval were ten
million years, one interval might be thirty million or
more and the next only one or two hundred thousand.
<!--File: cc289.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_265" title="pg 265"></a>
According to Schuchert, the known periods of glacial or
semi-glacial climate have been approximately as follows:</p>

     <li>c. Severe glacial period during Pleistocene.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This table suggests an interesting inquiry. During the
last few decades there has been great interest in ancient
glaciation and geologists have carefully examined rocks
of all ages for signs of glacial deposits. In spite of the
large parts of the earth which are covered with deposits
belonging to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which form the
<!--File: cc290.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_266" title="pg 266"></a>
last quarter of geological time, the only signs of actual
glaciation are those of the great Pleistocene period and a
few local occurrences at the end of the Mesozoic or beginning
of the Cenozoic. Late in the Triassic and early
in the Jurassic, the climate appears to have been rigorous,
although no tillites have been found to demonstrate
glaciation. In the preceding quarter, that is, the Paleozoic,
the Permian glaciation was more severe than that
of the Pleistocene, and the Devonian than that of the
Eocene, while the Ordovician evidences of low temperature
are stronger than those at the end of the Triassic.
In view of the fact that rocks of Paleozoic age cover
much smaller areas than do those of later age, the three
Paleozoic glaciations seem to indicate a relative frequency
of glaciation. Going back to the Proterozoic, it
is astonishing to find that evidence of two highly developed
glacial periods, and possibly four, has been discovered.
Since the Indian and the African glaciations of
Proterozoic times are as yet undated, we cannot be sure
that they are not of the same date as the others. Nevertheless,
even two is a surprising number, for not only
are most Proterozoic rocks so metamorphosed that possible
evidences of glacial origin are destroyed, but rocks
of that age occupy far smaller areas than either those
of Paleozoic or, still more, Mesozoic and Cenozoic age.
Thus the record of the last three-quarters of geological
time suggests that if rocks of all ages were as abundant
and as easily studied as those of the later periods, the
frequency of glacial periods would be found to increase
as one goes backward toward the beginnings of the
earth's history. This is interesting, for Jeans holds that
the chances that the stars would approach one another
were probably greater in the past than at present. This
conclusion is based on the assumption that our universe
<!--File: cc291.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_267" title="pg 267"></a>
is like the spiral nebul&aelig; in which the orbits of the various
members are nearly circular during the younger stages.
Jeans considers it certain that in such cases the orbits
will gradually become larger and more elliptical because
of the attraction of one body for another. Thus as time
goes on the stars will be more widely distributed and
the chances of approach will diminish. If this is correct,
the agreement between astronomical theory and geological
conclusions suggests that the two are at least not in
opposition.</p>

<p>The first quarter of geological time as well as the last
three must be considered in this connection. During the
Archeozoic, no evidence of glaciation has yet been discovered.
This suggests that the geological facts disprove
the astronomical theory. But our knowledge of early
geological times is extremely limited, so limited that
lack of evidence of glaciation in the Archeozoic may have
no significance. Archeozoic rocks have been studied
minutely over a very small percentage of the earth's land
surface. Moreover, they are highly metamorphosed so
that, even if glacial tills existed, it would be hard to
recognize them. Third, according to both the nebular and
the planetesimal hypotheses, it seems possible that
during the earliest stages of geological history the
earth's interior was somewhat warmer than now, and the
surface may have been warmed more than at present by
conduction, by lava flows, and by the fall of meteorites.
If the earth during the Archeozoic period emitted enough
heat to raise its surface temperature a few degrees, the
heat would not prevent the development of low forms of
life but might effectively prevent all glaciation. This
does not mean that it would prevent changes of climate,
but merely changes so extreme that their record would
be preserved by means of ice. It will be most interesting
<!--File: cc292.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_268" title="pg 268"></a>
to see whether future investigations in geology and
astronomy indicate either a semi-uniform distribution of
glacial periods throughout the past, or a more or less
regular decrease in frequency from early times down to
the present.</p>

<p>2. The Pleistocene glacial period was divided into at
least four epochs, while in the Permian at least one
inter-glacial epoch seems certain, and in some places the
alternation between glacial and non-glacial beds suggests
no less than nine. In the other glaciations the evidence is
not yet clear. The question of periodicity is so important
that it overthrows most glacial hypotheses. Indeed, had
their authors known the facts as established in recent
years, most of the hypotheses would never have been
advanced. The carbon dioxide hypothesis is the only one
which was framed with geologically rapid climatic alternations
in mind. It certainly explains the facts of periodicity
better than does any of its predecessors, but even
so it does not account for the intimate way in which
variations of all degrees from those of the weather up to
glacial epochs seem to grade into one another.</p>

<p>According to our stellar hypothesis, occasional groups
of glacial epochs would be expected to occur close together
and to form long glacial periods. This is because
many of the stars belong to groups or clusters in which
the stars move in parallel paths. A good example is the
cluster in the Hyades, where Boss has studied thirty-nine
stars with special care.<sup><a href="#fn123" id="r123">[123]</a></sup> The stars are grouped about a
center about 130 light years from the sun. The stars
themselves are scattered over an area about thirty
light years in diameter. They average about the same
distance apart as do those near the sun, but toward the
<!--File: cc293.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_269" title="pg 269"></a>
center of the group they are somewhat closer together.
The whole thirty-nine sweep forward in essentially
parallel paths. Boss estimates that 800,000 years ago
the cluster was only half as far from the sun as at present,
but probably that was as near as it has been during
recent geological times. All of the thirty-nine stars of this
cluster, as Moulton<sup><a href="#fn124" id="r124">[124]</a></sup> puts it, "are much greater in light-giving
power than the sun. The luminosities of even the
five smallest are from five to ten times that of the sun,
while the largest are one hundred times greater in light-giving
power than our own luminary. Their masses are
probably much greater than that of the sun." If the sun
were to pass through such a cluster, first one star and
then another might come so near as to cause a profound
disturbance in the sun's atmosphere.</p>

<p>3. Another important point upon which a glacial hypothesis
may come to grief is the length of the periods
or rather of the epochs which compose the periods.
During the last or Pleistocene glacial period the evidence
in America and Europe indicates that the inter-glacial
epochs varied in length and that the later ones were
shorter than the earlier. Chamberlin and Salisbury, from
a comparison of various authorities, estimate that the
intervals from one glacial epoch to another form a declining
series, which may be roughly expressed as follows:
16-8-4-2-1, where unity is the interval from the
climax of the late Wisconsin, or last glacial epoch, to the
present. Most authorities estimate the culmination of the
late Wisconsin glaciation as twenty or thirty thousand
years ago. Penck estimates the length of the last inter-glacial
period as 60,000 years and the preceding one as
240,000.<sup><a href="#fn125" id="r125">[125]</a></sup> R. T. Chamberlin, as already stated, finds that
<!--File: cc294.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_270" title="pg 270"></a>
the consensus of opinion is that inter-glacial epochs have
averaged five times as long as glacial epochs. The actual
duration of the various glaciations probably did not vary
in so great a ratio as did the intervals from one glaciation
to another. The main point, however, is the irregularity
of the various periods.</p>

<p>The relation of the stellar electrical hypothesis to the
length of glacial epochs may be estimated from column
C, in Table 5. There we see that the distances at which
a star might possibly disturb the sun enough to cause
glaciation range all the way from 120 billion miles in
the case of a small star like the sun, to 3200 billion in
the case of Betelgeuse, while for double stars the figure
may rise a hundred times higher. From this we can calculate
how long it would take a star to pass from a point
where its influence would first amount to a quarter of the
assumed maximum to a similar point on the other side of
the sun. In making these calculations we will assume that
the relative rate at which the star and the sun approach
each other is about twenty-two miles per second, or 700
million miles per year, which is the average rate of
motion of all the known stars. According to the distances
in Table 5 this gives a range from about 500 years up to
about 10,000, which might rise to a million in the case of
double stars. Of course the time might be relatively short
if the sun and a rapidly moving star were approaching
one another almost directly, or extremely long if the sun
and the star were moving in almost the same direction
and at somewhat similar rates,&mdash;a condition more
common than the other. Here, as in so many other cases,
the essential point is that the figures which we thus obtain
seem to be of the right order of magnitude.</p>

<p>4. Post-glacial climatic stages are so well known that
in Europe they have definite names. Their sequence has
<!--File: cc295.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_271" title="pg 271"></a>
already been discussed in Chapter XII. Fossils found in
the peat bogs of Denmark and Scandinavia, for example,
prove that since the final disappearance of the continental
ice cap at the close of the Wisconsin there has
been at least one period when the climate of Europe was
distinctly milder than now. Directly overlying the sheets
of glacial drift laid down by the ice there is a flora corresponding
to that of the present tundras. Next come remains
of a forest vegetation dominated by birches and
poplars, showing that the climate was growing a little
warmer. Third, there follow evidences of a still more
favorable climate in the form of a forest dominated by
pines; fourth, one where oak predominates; and fifth, a
flora similar to that of the Black Forest of Germany,
indicating that in Scandinavia the temperature was then
decidedly higher than today. This fifth flora has retreated
southward once more, having been driven back to its
present latitude by a slight recurrence of a cool stormy
climate.<sup><a href="#fn126" id="r126">[126]</a></sup> In central Asia evidence of post-glacial stages
is found not only in five distinct moraines but in a corresponding
series of elevated strands surrounding salt
lakes and of river terraces in non-glaciated arid regions.<sup><a href="#fn127" id="r127">[127]</a></sup></p>

<p>In historic as well as prehistoric times, as we have
already seen, there have been climatic fluctuations. For
instance, the twelfth or thirteenth century B. C. appears
to have been almost as mild as now, as does the seventh
century B. C. On the other hand about 1000 B. C., at the
time of Christ, and in the fourteenth century there were
times of relative severity. Thus it appears that both on
<!--File: cc296.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_272" title="pg 272"></a>
a large and on a small scale pulsations of climate are the
rule. Any hypothesis of climatic changes must satisfy
the periods of these pulsations. These conditions furnish
a problem which makes difficulty for almost all hypotheses
of climatic change. According to the present hypothesis,
earth movements such as are discussed in Chapter
XII may co&ouml;perate with two astronomical factors. One is
the constant change in the positions of the stars, a change
which we have already called kaleidoscopic, and the other
is the fact that a large proportion of the stars are double
or multiple. When one star in a group approaches the
sun closely enough to cause a great solar disturbance,
numerous others may approach or recede and have a
minor effect. Thus, whenever the sun is near groups of
stars we should expect that the earth would show many
minor climatic pulsations and stages which might or
might not be connected with glaciation. The historic
pulsations shown in the curve of tree growth in California,
Fig. 4, are the sort of changes that would be
expected if movements of the stars have an effect on the
solar atmosphere.</p>

<p>Not only are fully a third of all the visible stars double,
as we have already seen, but at least a tenth of these are
known to be triple or multiple. In many of the double
stars the two bodies are close together and revolve so
rapidly that whatever periodicity they might create in
the sun's atmosphere would be very short. In the triplets,
however, the third star is ordinarily at least ten times
as far from the other two as they are from each other,
and its period of rotation sometimes runs into hundreds
or thousands of years. An actual multiple star in the
constellation Polaris will serve as an example. The main
star is believed by Jeans to consist of two parts which
are almost in contact and whirl around each other with
<!--File: cc297.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_273" title="pg 273"></a>
extraordinary speed in four days. If this is true they
must keep each other's atmospheres in a state of intense
commotion. Much farther away a third star revolves
around this pair in twelve years. At a much greater distance
a fourth star revolves around the common center
of gravity of itself and the other three in a period which
may be 20,000 years. Still more complicated cases probably
exist. Suppose such a system were to traverse a
path where it would exert a perceptible influence on the
sun for thirty or forty thousand years. The varying
movements of its members would produce an intricate
series of cycles which might show all sorts of major and
minor variations in length and intensity. Thus the varied
and irregular stages of glaciation and the pulsations of
historic times might be accounted for on the hypothesis
of the proximity of the sun to a multiple star, as well as
on that of the less pronounced approach and recession
of a number of stars. In addition to all this, an almost
infinitely complex series of climatic changes of long and
short duration might arise if the sun passed through a
nebula.</p>

<p>5. We have seen in Chapter VIII that the contrast
between the somewhat severe climate of the present and
the generally mild climate of the past is one of the great
geological problems. The glacial period is not a thing
of the distant past. Geologists generally recognize that
it is still with us. Greenland and Antarctica are both
shrouded in ice sheets in latitudes where fossil floras
prove that at other periods the climate was as mild as
in England or even New Zealand. The present glaciated
regions, be it noted, are on the polar borders of the
world's two most stormy oceanic areas, just where ice
would be expected to last longest according to the solar
cyclonic hypothesis. In contrast with the semi-glacial
<!--File: cc298.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_274" title="pg 274"></a>
conditions of the present, the last inter-glacial epoch was
so mild that not only men but elephants and hippopotamuses
flourished in central Europe, while at earlier times
in the middle of long eras, such as the Paleozoic and
Mesozoic, corals, cycads, and tree ferns flourished within
the Arctic circle.</p>

<p>If the electro-stellar hypothesis of solar disturbances
proves well founded, it may explain these peculiarities.
Periods of mild climate would represent a return of the
sun and the earth to their normal conditions of quiet. At
such times the atmosphere of the sun is assumed to be
little disturbed by sunspots, facul&aelig;, prominences, and
other allied evidences of movements; and the rice-grain
structure is perhaps the most prominent of the solar
markings. The earth at such times is supposed to be
correspondingly free from cyclonic storms. Its winds are
then largely of the purely planetary type, such as trade
winds and westerlies. Its rainfall also is largely planetary
rather than cyclonic. It falls in places such as the
heat equator where the air rises under the influence of
heat, or on the windward slopes of mountains, or in regions
where warm winds blow from the ocean over cold
lands.</p>

<p>According to the electro-stellar hypothesis, the conditions
which prevailed during hundreds of millions of
years of mild climate mean merely that the solar system
was then in parts of the heavens where stars&mdash;especially
double stars&mdash;were rare or small, and electrical disturbances
correspondingly weak. Today, on the other hand,
the sun is fairly near a number of stars, many of which
are large doubles. Hence it is supposed to be disturbed,
although not so much as at the height of the last glacial
epoch.</p>

<p>After the preceding parts of this book had been
<!--File: cc299.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_275" title="pg 275"></a>
written, the assistance of Dr. Schlesinger made it possible
to test the electro-stellar hypothesis by comparing
actual astronomical dates with the dates of climatic or
solar phenomena. In order to make this possible, Dr.
Schlesinger and his assistants have prepared Table 6,
giving the position, magnitude, and motions of the thirty-eight
nearest stars, and especially the date at which each
was nearest the sun. In column 10 where the dates are
given, a minus sign indicates the past and a plus sign the
future. Dr. Shapley has kindly added column 12, giving
the absolute magnitudes of the stars, that of the sun
being 4.8, and column 13, showing their luminosity or
absolute radiation, that of the sun being unity. Finally,
column 14 shows the effective radiation received by the
sun from each star when the star is at a minimum distance.
Unity in this case is the effect of a star like the
sun at a distance of one light year.</p>

<p>It is well known that radiation of all kinds, including
light, heat, and electrical emissions, varies in direct proportion
to the exposed surface, that is, as the square
of the radius of a sphere, and inversely as the square of
the distance. From black bodies, as we have seen, the
total radiation varies as the fourth power of the absolute
temperature. It is not certain that either light or
electrical emissions from incandescent bodies vary in
quite this same proportion, nor is it yet certain whether
luminous and electrical emissions vary exactly together.
Nevertheless they are closely related. Since the light
coming from each star is accurately measured, while no
information is available as to electrical emissions, we
have followed Dr. Shapley's suggestion and used the
luminosity of the stars as the best available measure of
total radiation. This is presumably an approximate
measure of electrical activity, provided some allowance
be made for disturbances by outside bodies such as companion
stars. Hence the inclusion of column 14.</p>

<p>On the basis of column 14 and of the movements and
distances of the stars as given in the other columns Fig.
10 has been prepared. This gives an estimate of the
approximate electrical energy received by the sun from
the nearest stars for 70,000 years before and after the
present. It is based on the twenty-six stars for which
complete data are available in Table 6. The inclusion of
the other twelve would not alter the form of the curve,
for even the largest of them would not change any part
by more than about half of 1 per cent, if as much.
Nor would the curve be visibly altered by the omission
of all except four of the twenty-six stars actually used.
The four that are important, and their relative luminosity
when nearest the sun, are Sirius 429,000, Altair
153,000, Alpha Centauri 117,500, and Procyon 51,300.
The figure for the next star is only 4970, while for this
star combined with the other twenty-one that are unimportant
it is only 24,850.</p>

<p>Figure 10 is not carried more than 70,000 years into
the past or into the future because the stars near the
sun at more remote times are not included among the
thirty-eight having the largest known parallaxes. That
is, they have either moved away or are not yet near
enough to be included. Indeed, as Dr. Schlesinger
strongly emphasizes, there may be swiftly moving, bright
or gigantic stars which are now quite far away, but whose
inclusion would alter Fig. 10 even within the limits of
the 140,000 years there shown. It is almost certain, however,
that the most that these would do would be to raise,
but not obliterate, the minima on either side of the main
maximum.</p>

allowance for double stars. Passing by the twenty-two
unimportant stars, it appears that the companion of
Sirius is eight or ten magnitudes smaller than that star,
while the companions of Procyon and Altair are five or
more magnitudes smaller than their bright comrades.
This means that the luminosity of the faint components
is at most only 1 per cent of that of their bright companions
and in the case of Sirius not a hundredth of 1
per cent. Hence their inclusion would have no visible
effect on Fig. 10. In Alpha Centauri, on the other hand,
the two components are of almost the same magnitude.
For this reason the effective radiation of that star as
given in column 14 is doubled in Fig. 10, while for
another reason it is raised still more. The other reason
is that if our inferences as to the electrical effect of the
sun on the earth and of the planets on the sun are correct,
double stars, as we have seen, must be much more
effective electrically than single stars. By the same
reasoning two bright stars close together must excite
one another much more than a bright star and a very
faint one, even if the distances in both cases are the same.
So, too, other things being equal, a triple star must be
more excited electrically than a double star. Hence in
preparing Fig. 10 all double stars receive double weight
and each part of Alpha Centauri receives an additional
50 per cent because both parts are bright and because
they have a third companion to help in exciting them.</p>

<p>According to the electro-stellar hypothesis, Alpha Centauri
is more important climatically than any other star
in the heavens not only because it is triple and bright, but
because it is the nearest of all stars, and moves fairly
rapidly. Sirius and Procyon move slowly in respect to
the sun, only about eleven and eight kilometers per
second respectively, and their distances at minimum are
<!--File: cc305.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_281" title="pg 281"></a>
fairly large, that is, 8 and 10.2 light years. Hence their
effect on the sun changes slowly. Altair moves faster,
about twenty-six kilometers per second, and its minimum
distance is 6.4 light years, so that its effect changes fairly
rapidly. Alpha Centauri moves about twenty-four kilometers
per second, and its minimum distance is only 3.2
light years. Hence its effect changes very rapidly, the
change in its apparent luminosity as seen from the sun
amounting at maximum to about 30 per cent in 10,000
years against 14 per cent for Altair, 4 for Sirius, and 2
for Procyon. The vast majority of the stars change so
much more slowly than even Procyon that their effect is
almost uniform. All the stars at a distance of more than
perhaps twenty or thirty light years may be regarded as
sending to the sun a practically unchanging amount of
radiation. It is the bright stars within this limit which
are important, and their importance increases with their
proximity, their speed of motion, and the brightness and
number of their companions. Hence Alpha Centauri
causes the main maximum in Fig. 10, while Sirius, Altair,
and Procyon combine to cause a general rise of the curve
from the past to the future.</p>

<p>Let us now interpret Fig. 10 geologically. The low position
of the curve fifty to seventy thousand years ago
suggests a mild inter-glacial climate distinctly less severe
than that of the present. Geologists say that such was the
case. The curve suggests a glacial epoch culminating
about 28,000 years ago. The best authorities put the climax
of the last glacial epoch between twenty-five and
thirty thousand years ago. The curve shows an amelioration
of climate since that time, although it suggests that
there is still considerable severity. The retreat of the ice
from North America and Europe, and its persistence in
Greenland and Antarctica agree with this. And the curve
<!--File: cc306.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_282" title="pg 282"></a>
indicates that the change of climate is still persisting, a
conclusion in harmony with the evidence as to historic
changes.</p>

<p>If Alpha Centauri is really so important, the effect of
its variations, provided it has any, ought perhaps to be
evident in the sun. The activity of the star's atmosphere
presumably varies, for the orbits of the two components
have an eccentricity of 0.51. Hence during their period
of revolution, 81.2 years, the distance between them
ranges from 1,100,000,000 to 3,300,000,000 miles. They
were at a minimum distance in 1388, 1459, 1550, 1631,
1713, 1794, 1875, and will be again in 1956. In Fig.
11, showing sunspot variations, it is noticeable that the
years 1794 and 1875 come just at the ends of periods of
unusual solar activity, as indicated by the heavy horizontal
line. A similar period of great activity seems to
have begun about 1914. If its duration equals the average
of its two predecessors, it will end about 1950. Back in
the fourteenth century a period of excessive solar activity,
which has already been described, culminated from
1370 to 1385, or just before the two parts of Alpha Centauri
were at a minimum distance. Thus in three and
perhaps four cases the sun has been unusually active
during a time when the two parts of the star were most
rapidly approaching each other and when their atmospheres
were presumably most disturbed and their electrical
emanations strongest.</p>

<p>The fact that Alpha Centauri, the star which would be
expected most strongly to influence the sun, and hence
the earth, was nearest the sun at the climax of the last
glacial epoch, and that today the solar atmosphere is
most active when the star is presumably most disturbed
may be of no significance. It is given for what it is worth.
Its importance lies not in the fact that it proves anything,

but that no contradiction is found when we test
the electro-stellar hypothesis by facts which were not
thought of when the hypothesis was framed. A vast
amount of astronomical work is still needed before the
matter can be brought to any definite conclusion. In case
the hypothesis stands firm, it may be possible to use the
stars as a help in determining the exact chronology of the
later part of geological times. If the hypothesis is disproved,
it will merely leave the question of solar variations
where it is today. It will not influence the main
conclusions of this book as to the causes and nature of
climatic changes. Its value lies in the fact that it calls
attention to new lines of research.</p>

<h3>THE EARTH'S CRUST AND THE SUN</h3>


<p>Although the problems of this book may lead far
afield, they ultimately bring us back to the earth
and to the present. Several times in the preceding
pages there has been mention of the fact that periods of
extreme climatic fluctuations are closely associated with
great movements of the earth's crust whereby mountains
are uplifted and continents upheaved. In attempting to
explain this association the general tendency has been
to look largely at the past instead of the present. Hence
it has been almost impossible to choose among three
possibilities, all beset with difficulties. First, the movements
of the crust may have caused the climatic fluctuations;
second, climatic changes may cause crustal movements;
and third, variations in solar activity or in some
other outside agency may give rise to both types of terrestrial
phenomena.</p>

<p>The idea that movements of the earth's crust are the
main cause of geological changes of climate is becoming
increasingly untenable as the complexity and rapidity of
climatic changes become more clear, especially during
post-glacial times. It implies that the earth's surface
moves up and down with a speed and facility which
appear to be out of the question. If volcanic activity be
invoked the problem becomes no clearer. Even if volcanic
dust should fill the air frequently and completely, neither
its presence nor absence would produce such peculiar features
<!--File: cc310.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_286" title="pg 286"></a>
as the localization of glaciers, the distribution of
loess, and the mild climate of most parts of geological
time. Nevertheless, because of the great difficulties presented
by the other two possibilities many geologists
still hold that directly or indirectly the greater climatic
changes have been mainly due to movements of the
earth's crust and to the reaction of the crustal movements
on the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The possibility that climatic changes are in themselves
a cause of movements of the earth's crust seems so improbable
that no one appears to have investigated it with
any seriousness. Nevertheless, it is worth while to raise
the question whether climatic extremes may co&ouml;perate
with other agencies in setting the time when the earth's
crust shall be deformed.</p>

<p>As to the third possibility, it is perfectly logical to
ascribe both climatic changes and crustal deformation to
some outside agency, solar or otherwise, but hitherto
there has been so little evidence on this point that such
an ascription has merely begged the question. If heavenly
bodies should approach the earth closely enough so that
their gravitational stresses caused crustal deformation,
all life would presumably be destroyed. As to the sun,
there has hitherto been no conclusive evidence that it is
related to crustal movements, although various writers
have made suggestions along this line. In this chapter
we shall carry these suggestions further and shall see
that they are at least worthy of study.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to this study it may be well to note
that the coincidence between movements of the earth's
crust and climatic changes is not so absolute as is sometimes
supposed. For example, the profound crustal
changes at the end of the Mesozoic were not accompanied
by widespread glaciation so far as is yet known, although
<!--File: cc311.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_287" title="pg 287"></a>
the temperature appears to have been lowered. Nor was
the violent volcanic and diastrophic activity in the Miocene
associated with extreme climates. Indeed, there
appears to have been little contrast from zone to zone,
for figs, bread fruit trees, tree ferns, and other plants of
low latitudes grew in Greenland. Nevertheless, both at
the end of the Mesozoic and in the Miocene the climate
may possibly have been severe for a time, although the
record is lost. On the other hand, Kirk's recent discovery
of glacial till in Alaska between beds carrying an undoubted
Middle Silurian fauna indicates glaciation at a
time when there was little movement of the crust so far
as yet appears.<sup><a href="#fn129" id="r129">[129]</a></sup> Thus we conclude that while climatic
changes and crustal movements usually occur together,
they may occur separately.</p>

<p>According to the solar-cyclonic hypothesis such a condition
is to be expected. If the sun were especially active
when the terrestrial conditions prohibited glaciation,
changes of climate would still occur, but they would be
milder than under other circumstances, and would leave
little record in the rocks. Or there might be glaciation in
high latitudes, such as that of southern Alaska in the
Middle Silurian, and none elsewhere. On the other hand,
when the sun was so inactive that no great storminess
occurred, the upheaval of continents and the building of
mountains might go on without the formation of ice
sheets, as apparently happened at the end of the Mesozoic.
The lack of absolute coincidence between glaciation
and periods of widespread emergence of the lands is
evident even today, for there is no reason to suppose
that the lands are notably lower or less extensive now
than they were during the Pleistocene glaciation. In
fact, there is much evidence that many areas have risen
<!--File: cc312.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_288" title="pg 288"></a>
since that time. Yet glaciation is now far less extensive
than in the Pleistocene. Any attempt to explain this difference
on the basis of terrestrial changes is extremely
difficult, for the shape and altitude of continents and
mountains have not changed much in twenty or thirty
thousand years. Yet the present moderately mild epoch,
like the puzzling inter-glacial epochs of earlier times, is
easily explicable on the assumption that the sun's atmosphere
may sometimes vary in harmony with crustal
activity, but does not necessarily do so at all times.</p>

<p>Turning now to the main problem of how climatic
changes may be connected with movements of the earth's
crust, let us follow our usual method and examine what
is happening today. Let us first inquire whether earthquakes,
which are one of the chief evidences that crustal
movements are actually taking place in our own times,
show any connection with sunspots. In order to test this,
we have compared <em>Milne's Catalogue of Destructive
Earthquakes</em> from 1800 to 1899, with Wolf's sunspot
numbers for the same period month by month. The earthquake
catalogue, as its compiler describes it, "is an
attempt to give a list of earthquakes which have announced
changes of geological importance in the earth's
crust; movements which have probably resulted in the
creation or the extension of a line of fault, the vibrations
accompanying which could, with proper instruments,
have been recorded over a continent or the whole surface
of our world. Small earthquakes have been excluded,
while the number of large earthquakes both for ancient
and modern times has been extended. As an illustration
of exclusion, I may mention that between 1800 and 1808,
which are years taken at random, I find in Mallet's catalogue
407 entries. Only thirty-seven of these, which were
accompanied by structural damage, have been retained.
<!--File: cc313.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_289" title="pg 289"></a>
Other catalogues such as those of Perry and Fuchs have
been treated similarly."<sup><a href="#fn130" id="r130">[130]</a></sup></p>

<p>If the earthquakes in such a carefully selected list bear
a distinct relation to sunspots, it is at least possible and
perhaps probable that a similar relation may exist between
solar activity and geological changes in the earth's
crust. The result of the comparison of earthquakes and
sunspots is shown in Table 7. The first column gives the
sunspot numbers; the second, the number of months that
had the respective spot numbers during the century from
1800 to 1899. Column C shows the total number of earthquakes
during the months having any particular degree
of spottedness; while D, which is the significant column,
gives the average number of destructive earthquakes per
month under each of the six conditions of solar spottedness.</p>

<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_290" title="pg 290"></a>
<p>The regularity of column D is so great as to make
it almost certain that we are here dealing with a real
relationship. Column F, which shows the average number
of earthquakes in the month succeeding any given condition
of the sun, is still more regular except for the last
entry.</p>

<p>The chance that six numbers taken at random will
arrange themselves in any given order is one in 720. In
other words, there is one chance in 720 that the regularity
of column D is accidental. But column F is as regular as
column D except for the last entry. If columns D and E
were independent there would be one chance in about
500,000 that the six numbers in both columns would
fall in the same order, and one chance in 14,400 that
five numbers in each would fall in the same order.
But the two columns are somewhat related, for although
the after-shocks of a great earthquake are never included
in Milne's table, a world-shaking earthquake in one
region during a given month probably creates conditions
that favor similar earthquakes elsewhere during the next
month. Hence the probability that we are dealing with a
purely accidental arrangement in Table 7 is less than one
in 14,400 and greater than one in 500,000. It may be one
in 20,000 or 100,000. In any event it is so slight that there
is high probability that directly or indirectly sunspots
and earthquakes are somehow connected.</p>

<p>In ascertaining the relation between sunspots and
earthquakes it would be well if we could employ the strict
method of correlation coefficients. This, however, is impossible
for the entire century, for the record is by no
means homogeneous. The earlier decades are represented
by only about one-fourth as many earthquakes as the
later ones, a condition which is presumably due to lack of
information. This makes no difference with the method
<!--File: cc315.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_291" title="pg 291"></a>
employed in Table 7, since years with many and few sunspots
are distributed almost equally throughout the
entire nineteenth century, but it renders the method of
correlation coefficients inapplicable. During the period
from 1850 onward the record is much more nearly homogeneous,
though not completely so. Even in these later
decades, however, allowance must be made for the fact
that there are more earthquakes in winter than in
summer, the average number per month for the fifty
years being as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>The correlation coefficient between the departures from
these monthly averages and the corresponding departures
from the monthly averages of the sunspots for the
same period, 1850-1899, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sunspots and earthquakes of same month: +0.042, or 1.5
times the probable error.</p>

<p>Sunspots of a given month and earthquakes of that month
and the next: +0.084, or 3.1 times the probable error.</p>

<p>Sunspots of three consecutive months and earthquakes of
three consecutive months allowing a lag of one month, i.e., sunspots
of January, February, and March compared with earthquakes
of February, March, and April; sunspots of February,
March, and April with earthquakes of March, April, and May,
etc.; +0.112, or 4.1 times the probable error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These coefficients are all small, but the number of individual
cases, 600 months, is so large that the probable
error is greatly reduced, being only &plusmn;0.027 or &plusmn;0.028.
Moreover, the nature of our data is such that even if
<!--File: cc316.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_292" title="pg 292"></a>
there is a strong connection between solar changes and
earth movements, we should not expect a large correlation
coefficient. In the first place, as already mentioned,
the earthquake data are not strictly homogeneous.
Second, an average of about two and one-half strong
earthquakes per month is at best only a most imperfect
indication of the actual movement of the earth's crust.
Third, the sunspots are only a partial and imperfect
measure of the activity of the sun's atmosphere. Fourth,
the relation between solar activity and earthquakes is
almost certainly indirect. In view of all these conditions,
the regularity of Table 7 and the fact that the most important
correlation coefficient rises to more than four
times the probable error makes it almost certain that the
solar and terrestrial phenomena are really connected.</p>

<p>We are now confronted by the perplexing question of
how this connection can take place. Thus far only three
possibilities present themselves, and each is open to
objections. The chief agencies concerned in these three
possibilities are heat, electricity, and atmospheric pressure.
Heat may be dismissed very briefly. We have seen
that the earth's surface becomes relatively cool when
the sun is active. Theoretically even the slightest change
in the temperature of the earth's surface must influence
the thermal gradient far into the interior and hence cause
a change of volume which might cause movements of the
crust. Practically the heat of the surface ceases to be of
appreciable importance at a depth of perhaps twenty
feet, and even at that depth it does not act quickly enough
to cause the relatively prompt response which seems to be
characteristic of earthquakes in respect to the sun.</p>

<p>The second possibility is based on the relationship
between solar and terrestrial electricity. When the sun
is active the earth's atmospheric electrical potential is
<!--File: cc317.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_293" title="pg 293"></a>
subject to slight variations. It is well known that when
two opposing points of an ionized solution are oppositely
charged electrically, a current passes through the liquid
and sets up electrolysis whereby there is a segregation
of materials, and a consequent change in the volume of
the parts near the respective electrical poles. The same
process takes place, although less freely, in a hot mass
such as forms the interior of the earth. The question
arises whether internal electrical currents may not pass
between the two oppositely charged poles of the earth,
or even between the great continental masses and the
regions of heavier rock which underlie the oceans. Could
this lead to electrolysis, hence to differentiation in volume,
and thus to movements of the earth's crust? Could
the results vary in harmony with the sun? Bowie<sup><a href="#fn131" id="r131">[131]</a></sup> has
shown that numerous measurements of the strength and
direction of the earth's gravitative pull are explicable
only on the assumption that the upheaval of a continent
or a mountain range is due in part not merely to pressure,
or even to flowage of the rocks beneath the crust,
but also to an actual change in volume whereby the rocks
beneath the continent attain relatively great volume and
those under the oceans a small volume in proportion to
their weight. The query arises whether this change of
volume may be related to electrical currents at some
depth below the earth's surface.</p>

<p>The objections to this hypothesis are numerous. First,
there is little evidence of electrolytic differentiation in
the rocks. Second, the outer part of the earth's crust is a
very poor conductor so that it is doubtful whether even
a high degree of electrification of the surface would have
much effect on the interior. Third, electrolysis due to any
<!--File: cc318.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_294" title="pg 294"></a>
such mild causes as we have here postulated must be an
extremely slow process, too slow, presumably, to have
any appreciable result within a month or two. Other
objections join with these three in making it seem improbable
that the sun's electrical activity has any direct
effect upon movements of the earth's crust.</p>

<p>The third, or meteorological hypothesis, which makes
barometric pressure the main intermediary between solar
activity and earthquakes, seems at first sight almost as
improbable as the thermal and electrical hypotheses.
Nevertheless, it has a certain degree of observational
support of a kind which is wholly lacking in the other two
cases. Among the extensive writings on the periodicity of
earthquakes one main fact stands out with great distinctness:
earthquakes vary in number according to the
season. This fact has already been shown incidentally in
the table of earthquake frequency by months. If allowance
is made for the fact that February is a short month,
there is a regular decrease in the frequency of severe
earthquakes from December and January to June. Since
most of Milne's earthquakes occurred in the northern
hemisphere, this means that severe earthquakes occur in
winter about 20 per cent oftener than in summer.</p>

<p>The most thorough investigation of this subject seems
to have been that of Davisson.<sup><a href="#fn132" id="r132">[132]</a></sup> His results have been
worked over and amplified by Knott,<sup><a href="#fn133" id="r133">[133]</a></sup> who has tested
them by Schuster's exact mathematical methods. His results
are given in Table 8.<sup><a href="#fn134" id="r134">[134]</a></sup> Here the northern hemisphere
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_296" title="pg 296"></a>
is placed first; then come the East Indies and the Malay
Archipelago lying close to the equator; and finally the
southern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere practically
all the maxima come in the winter, for the month
of December appears in fifteen cases out of the twenty-five
in column D, while January, February, or November
appears in six others. It is also noticeable that in sixteen
cases out of twenty-five the ratio of the actual to the expected
amplitude in column G is four or more, so that a
real relationship is indicated, while the ratio falls below
three only in Japan and Zante. The equatorial data,
unlike those of the northern hemisphere, are indefinite,
for in the East Indies no month shows a marked maximum
and the expected amplitude exceeds the actual amplitude.
Even in the Malay Archipelago, which shows a
maximum in May, the ratio of actual to expected amplitude
is only 2.6. Turning to the southern hemisphere, the
winter months of that hemisphere are as strongly marked
by a maximum as are the winter months of the northern
<!--File: cc321.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_297" title="pg 297"></a>
hemisphere. July or August appears in five out of six
cases. Here the ratio between the actual and expected
amplitudes is not so great as in the northern hemisphere.
Nevertheless, it is practically four in Chile, and exceeds
five in Peru and Bolivia, and in the data for the entire
southern hemisphere.</p>



<p>The whole relationship between earthquakes and the
seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres is
summed up in Fig. 12 taken from Knott. The northern
hemisphere shows a regular diminution in earthquake
frequency from December until June, and an increase
the rest of the year. In the southern hemisphere the
course of events is the same so far as summer and winter
are concerned, for August with its maximum comes in
winter, while February with its minimum comes in
summer. In the southern hemisphere the winter month
of greatest seismic activity has over 100 per cent more
earthquakes than the summer month of least activity. In
the northern hemisphere this difference is about 80 per
cent, but this smaller figure occurs partly because the
northern data include certain interesting and significant
regions like Japan and China where the usual conditions
are reversed.<sup><a href="#fn135" id="r135">[135]</a></sup> If equatorial regions were included
in Fig. 12, they would give an almost straight line.</p>

<p>The connection between earthquakes and the seasons is
so strong that almost no students of seismology question
it, although they do not agree as to its cause. A meteorological
hypothesis seems to be the only logical explanation.<sup><a href="#fn136" id="r136">[136]</a></sup>
Wherever sufficient data are available, earthquakes
<!--File: cc322.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_298" title="pg 298"></a>
appear to be most numerous when climatic conditions
cause the earth's surface to be most heavily loaded or to
change its load most rapidly. The main factor in the
loading is apparently atmospheric pressure. This acts in
two ways. First, when the continents become cold in
winter the pressure increases. On an average the air
at sea level presses upon the earth's surface at the rate
of 14.7 pounds per square inch, or over a ton per square
foot, and only a little short of thirty million tons per
square mile. An average difference of one inch between
the atmospheric pressure of summer and winter over ten
million square miles of the continent of Asia, for example,
means that the continent's load in winter is about
ten million million tons heavier than in summer. Second,
the changes in atmospheric pressure due to the passage
of storms are relatively sharp and sudden. Hence they
are probably more effective than the variations in the
load from season to season. This is suggested by the
rapidity with which the terrestrial response seems to
follow the supposed solar cause of earthquakes. It is also
suggested by the fact that violent storms are frequently
followed by violent earthquakes. "Earthquake weather,"
as Dr. Schlesinger suggests, is a common phrase in the
typhoon region of Japan, China, and the East Indies.
During tropical hurricanes a change of pressure amounting
to half an inch in two hours is common. On September
<!--File: cc323.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_299" title="pg 299"></a>
22, 1885, at False Point Lighthouse on the Bay of
Bengal, the barometer fell about an inch in six hours,
then nearly an inch and a half in not much over two
hours, and finally rose fully two inches inside of two
hours. A drop of two inches in barometric pressure
means that a load of about two million tons is removed

<!--File: cc324.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_300" title="pg 300"></a>
from each square mile of land; the corresponding rise of
pressure means the addition of a similar load. Such a
storm, and to a less degree every other storm, strikes a
blow upon the earth's surface, first by removing millions
of tons of pressure and then by putting them on again.<sup><a href="#fn137" id="r137">[137]</a></sup>
Such storms, as we have seen, are much more frequent
and severe when sunspots are numerous than at other
times. Moreover, as Veeder<sup><a href="#fn138" id="r138">[138]</a></sup> long ago showed, one of the
most noteworthy evidences of a connection between sunspots
and the weather is a sudden increase of pressure in
certain widely separated high pressure areas. In most
parts of the world winter is not only the season of
highest pressure and of most frequent changes of
Veeder's type, but also of severest storms. Hence a
meteorological hypothesis would lead to the expectation
that earthquakes would occur more frequently in winter
than in summer. On the Chinese coast, however, and also
on the oceanic side of Japan, as well as in some more
tropical regions, the chief storms come in summer in the
form of typhoons. These are the places where earthquakes
also are most abundant in summer. Thus, wherever
we turn, storms and the related barometric changes
seem to be most frequent and severe at the very times
when earthquakes are also most frequent.</p>

&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; Northern Hemisphere.<br />
- - - - Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Other meteorological factors, such as rain, snow,
winds, and currents, probably have some effect on earthquakes
<!--File: cc325.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_301" title="pg 301"></a>
through their ability to load the earth's crust.
The coming of vegetation may also help. These agencies,
however, appear to be of small importance compared
with the storms. In high latitudes and in regions of
abundant storminess most of these factors generally
combine with barometric pressure to produce frequent
changes in the load of the earth's crust, especially in
winter. In low latitudes, on the other hand, there are few
severe storms, and relatively little contrast in pressure
and vegetation from season to season; there is no snow;
and the amount of ground water changes little. With this
goes the twofold fact that there is no marked seasonal
distribution of earthquakes, and that except in certain
local volcanic areas, earthquakes appear to be rare. In
proportion to the areas concerned, for example, there is
little evidence of earthquakes in equatorial Africa and
South America.</p>

<p>The question of the reality of the connection between
meteorological conditions and crustal movements is so
important that every possible test should be applied. At
the suggestion of Professor Schlesinger we have looked
up a very ingenious line of inquiry. During the last
decades of the nineteenth century, a long series of extremely
accurate observations of latitude disclosed a fact
which had previously been suspected but not demonstrated,
namely, that the earth wabbles a little about its
axis. The axis itself always points in the same direction,
and since the earth slides irregularly around it the latitude
of all parts of the earth keeps changing. Chandler
has shown that the wabbling thus induced consists of
two parts. The first is a movement in a circle with a
radius of about fifteen feet which is described in approximately
430 days. This so-called Eulerian movement is a
normal gyroscopic motion like the slow gyration of a
<!--File: cc326.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_302" title="pg 302"></a>
spinning top. This depends on purely astronomical
causes, and no terrestrial cause can stop it or eliminate
it. The period appears to be constant, but there are certain
puzzling irregularities. The usual amplitude of this
movement, as Schlesinger<sup><a href="#fn139" id="r139">[139]</a></sup> puts it, "is about 0".27, but
twice in recent years it has jumped to 0".40. Such a
change could be accounted for by supposing that the
earth had received a severe blow or a series of milder
blows tending in the same direction." These blows, which
were originally suggested by Helmert are most interesting
in view of our suggestion as to the blows struck by
storms.</p>

<p>The second movement of the pole has a period of a
year, and is roughly an ellipse whose longest radius is
fourteen feet and the shortest, four feet; or, to put it
technically, there is an annual term with a maximum
amplitude of about 0".20. This, however, varies irregularly.
The result is that the pole seems to wander over
the earth's surface in the spiral fashion illustrated in
Fig. 13. It was early suggested that this peculiar wandering
of the pole in an annual period must be due to
meteorological causes. Jeffreys<sup><a href="#fn140" id="r140">[140]</a></sup> has investigated the
matter exhaustively. He assumes certain reasonable
values for the weight of air added or subtracted from
different parts of the earth's surface according to the
seasons. He also considers the effect of precipitation,
vegetation, and polar ice, and of variations of temperature
and atmospheric pressure in their relation to movements
of the ocean. Then he proceeds to compare all
<!--File: cc327.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_303" title="pg 303"></a>

these with the actual wandering of the pole from 1907
to 1913. While it is as yet too early to say that any
special movement of the pole was due to the specific
meteorological conditions of any particular year,
Jeffreys' work makes it clear that meteorological causes,
especially atmospheric pressure, are sufficient to cause
the observed irregular wanderings. Slight wanderings
may arise from various other sources such as movements
of the rocks when geological faults occur or the rush of
a great wave due to a submarine earthquake. So far as
known, however, all these other agencies cause insignificant
displacements compared with those arising from
movements of the air. This fact coupled with the mathematical
certainty that meteorological phenomena must
produce some wandering of the pole, has caused most
astronomers to accept Jeffreys' conclusion. If we follow
their example we are led to conclude that changes in
atmospheric pressure and in the other meteorological
conditions strike blows which sometimes shift the earth
<!--File: cc328.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_304" title="pg 304"></a>
several feet from its normal position in respect to the
axis.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Fig. 13. Wandering of the

(<em>After Moulton.</em>)</p>

<p>If the foregoing reasoning is correct, the great and
especially the sudden departures from the smooth
gyroscopic circle described by the pole in the Eulerian
motion would be expected to occur at about the same time
as unusual earthquake activity. This brings us to an
interesting inquiry carried out by Milne<sup><a href="#fn141" id="r141">[141]</a></sup> and amplified
by Knott.<sup><a href="#fn142" id="r142">[142]</a></sup> Taking Albrecht's representation of the
irregular spiral-like motion of the pole, as given in Fig.
13, they show that there is a preponderance of severe
earthquakes at times when the direction of motion of the
earth in reference to its axis departs from the smooth
Eulerian curve. A summary of their results is given in
Table 9. The table indicates that during the period from
1892 to 1905 there were nine different times when the
curve of Fig. 13 changed its direction or was deflected by
less than 10&deg; during a tenth of a year. In other words,
during those periods it did not curve as much as it ought
according to the Eulerian movement. At such times there
were 179 world-shaking earthquakes, or an average of
about 19.9 per tenth of a year. According to the other
lines of Table 9, in thirty-two cases the deflection during
a tenth of a year was between 10&deg; and 25&deg;, while in fifty-six
cases it was from 25&deg; to 40&deg;. During these periods
the curve remained close to the Eulerian path and the
world-shaking earthquakes averaged only 8.2 and 12.9.
Then, when the deflection was high, that is, when meteorological
conditions threw the earth far out of its Eulerian
course, the earthquakes were again numerous, the
number rising to 23.4 when the deflection amounted to
more than 55&deg;.</p>

<p>In order to test this conclusion in another way we have
followed a suggestion of Professor Schlesinger. Under
his advice the Eulerian motion has been eliminated and
a new series of earthquake records has been compared
with the remaining motions of the poles which presumably
arise largely from meteorological causes. For this
purpose use has been made of the very full records of
earthquakes published under the auspices of the International
Seismological Commission for the years 1903
to 1908, the only years for which they are available.
These include every known shock of every description
which was either recorded by seismographs or by direct
observation in any part of the world. Each shock is given
the same weight, no matter what its violence or how
closely it follows another. The angle of deflection has
been measured as Milne measured it, but since the Eulerian
motion is eliminated, our zero is approximately
the normal condition which would prevail if there were
no meteorological complications. Dividing the deflections
into six equal groups according to the size of the angle,
we get the result shown in Table 10.</p>

<p>Here where some twenty thousand earthquakes are
employed the result agrees closely with that of Milne for
a different series of years and for a much smaller number
of earthquakes. So long as the path of the pole departs
less than about 45&deg; from the smooth gyroscopic Eulerian
path, the number of earthquakes is almost constant, about
eight and a quarter per day. When the angle becomes
large, however, the number increases by nearly 50 per
cent. Thus the work of Milne, Knott, and Jeffreys is confirmed
by a new investigation. Apparently earthquakes
and crustal movements are somehow related to sudden
changes in the load imposed on the earth's crust by
meteorological conditions.</p>

<p>This conclusion is quite as surprising to the authors
as to the reader&mdash;perhaps more so. At the beginning of
this investigation we had no faith whatever in any important
<!--File: cc331.png Page 307-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_307" title="pg 307"></a>
relation between climate and earthquakes. At its
end we are inclined to believe that the relation is close
and important.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that meteorological
conditions are the <em>cause</em> of earthquakes and of movements
of the earth's crust. Even though the load that the
climatic agencies can impose upon the earth's crust runs
into millions of tons per square mile, it is a trifle compared
with what the crust is able to support. There is,
however, a great difference between the cause and the
occasion of a phenomenon. Suppose that a thick sheet of
glass is placed under an increasing strain. If the strain
is applied slowly enough, even so rigid a material as glass
will ultimately bend rather than break. But suppose that
while the tension is high the glass is tapped. A gentle
tap may be followed by a tiny crack. A series of little
taps may be the signal for small cracks to spread in
every direction. A few slightly harder taps may cause
the whole sheet to break suddenly into many pieces. Yet
even the hardest tap may be the merest trifle compared
with the strong force which is keeping the glass in a state
of strain and which would ultimately bend it if given
time.</p>

<p>The earth as a whole appears to stand between steel
and glass in rigidity. It is a matter of common observation
that rocks stand high in this respect and in the
consequent difficulty with which they can be bent without
breaking. Because of the earth's contraction the crust
endures a constant strain, which must gradually become
enormous. This strain is increased by the fact that sediment
is transferred from the lands to the borders of the
sea and there forms areas of thick accumulation. From
this has arisen the doctrine of isostasy, or of the equalization
of crustal pressure. An important illustration of
<!--File: cc332.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_308" title="pg 308"></a>
this is the oceanward and equatorial creep which has
been described in Chapter XI. There we saw that when
the lands have once been raised to high levels or when a
shortening of the earth's axis by contraction has increased
the oceanic bulge at the equator, or when the
reverse has happened because of tidal retardation, the
outer part of the earth appears to creep slowly back
toward a position of perfect isostatic adjustment. If the
sun had no influence upon the earth, either direct or
indirect, isostasy and other terrestrial processes might
flex the earth's crust so gradually that changes in the
form and height of the lands would always take place
slowly, even from the geological point of view. Thus
erosion would usually be able to remove the rocks as
rapidly as they were domed above the general level. If
this happened, mountains would be rare or unknown, and
hence climatic contrasts would be far less marked than is
actually the case on our earth where crustal movements
have repeatedly been rapid enough to produce mountains.</p>

<p>Nature's methods rarely allow so gradual an adjustment
to the forces of isostasy. While the crust is under a
strain, not only because of contraction, but because of
changes in its load through the transference of sediments
and the slow increase or decrease in the bulge at the
equator, the atmosphere more or less persistently carries
on the tapping process. The violence of that process
varies greatly, and the variations depend largely on the
severity of the climatic contrasts. If the main outlines of
the cyclonic hypothesis are reliable, one of the first effects
of a disturbance of the sun's atmosphere is increased
storminess upon the earth. This is accompanied by increased
intensity in almost every meteorological process.
The most important effect, however, so far as the earth's
crust is concerned would apparently be the rapid and
<!--File: cc333.png Page 309-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_309" title="pg 309"></a>
intense changes of atmospheric pressure which would
arise from the swift passage of one severe storm after
another. Each storm would be a little tap on the tensely
strained crust. Any single tap might be of little consequence,
even though it involved a change of a billion
tons in the pressure on an area no larger than the state
of Rhode Island. Yet a rapid and irregular succession of
such taps might possibly cause the crust to crack, and
finally to collapse in response to stresses arising from
the shrinkage of the earth.</p>

<p>Another and perhaps more important effect of variations
in storminess and especially in the location of the
stormy areas would be an acceleration of erosion in some
places and a retardation elsewhere. A great increase in
rainfall may almost denude the slopes of soil, while a
diminution to the point where much of the vegetation
dies off has a similar effect. If such changes should take
place rapidly, great thicknesses of sediment might be
concentrated in certain areas in a short time, thus disturbing
the isostatic adjustment of the earth's crust. This
might set up a state of strain which would ultimately
have to be relieved, thus perhaps initiating profound
crustal movements. Changes in the load of the earth's
crust due to erosion and the deposition of sediment, no
matter how rapid they may be from the geological standpoint,
are slow compared with those due to changes in
barometric pressure. A drop of an inch in barometric
pressure is equivalent to the removal of about five inches
of solid rock. Even under the most favorable circumstances,
the removal of an average depth of five inches
of rock or its equivalent in soil over millions of square
miles would probably take several hundred years, while
the removal of a similar load of air might occur in half
a day or even a few hours. Thus the erosion and deposition
<!--File: cc334.png Page 310-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_310" title="pg 310"></a>
due to climatic variations presumably play their
part in crustal deformation chiefly by producing crustal
stresses, while the storms, as it were, strike sharp, sudden
blows.</p>

<p>Suppose now that a prolonged period of world-wide
mild climate, such as is described in Chapter X, should
permit an enormous accumulation of stresses due to contraction
and tidal retardation. Suppose that then a
sudden change of climate should produce a rapid shifting
of the deep soil that had accumulated on the lands, with a
corresponding localization and increase in strains. Suppose
also that frequent and severe storms play their part,
whether great or small, by producing an intensive tapping
of the crust. In such a case the ultimate collapse would
be correspondingly great, as would be evident in the
succeeding geological epoch. The sea floor might sink
lower, the continents might be elevated, and mountain
ranges might be shoved up along lines of special weakness.
This is the story of the geological period as known
to historical geology. The force that causes such movements
would be the pull of gravity upon the crust surrounding
the earth's shrinking interior. Nevertheless
climatic changes might occasionally set the date when the
gravitative pull would finally overcome inertia, and thus
usher in the crustal movements that close old geologic
periods and inaugurate new ones. This, however, could
occur only if the crust were under sufficient strain. As
Lawson<sup><a href="#fn143" id="r143">[143]</a></sup> says in his discussion of the "elastic rebound
theory," the sudden shifts of the crust which seem to be
the underlying cause of earthquakes "can occur only
after the accumulation of strain to a limit and ... this
accumulation involves a slow creep of the region affected.
<!--File: cc335.png Page 311-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_311" title="pg 311"></a>
In the long periods between great earthquakes the energy
necessary for such shocks is being stored up in the rocks
as elastic compression."</p>

<p>If a period of intense storminess should occur when
the earth as a whole was in such a state of strain, the
sudden release of the strains might lead to terrestrial
changes which would alter the climate still further, making
it more extreme, and perhaps permitting the storminess
due to the solar disturbances to bring about glaciation.
At the same time if volcanic activity should
increase it would add its quota to the tendency toward
glaciation. Nevertheless, it might easily happen that a
very considerable amount of crustal movement would
take place without causing a continental ice sheet or even
a marked alpine ice sheet. Or again, if the strains in the
earth's crust had already been largely released through
other agencies before the stormy period began, the climate
might become severe enough to cause glaciation
in high latitudes without leading to any very marked
movements of the earth's crust, as apparently happened
in the Mid-Silurian period.</p>


<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#content">CONCLUSION</a></h2>

<p>Here we must bring this study of the earth's evolution
to a close. Its fundamental principle has been that the
present, if rightly understood, affords a full key to the
past. With this as a guide we have touched on many
hypotheses, some essential and some unessential to the
general line of thought. The first main hypothesis is that
the earth's present climatic variations are correlated
with changes in the solar atmosphere. This is the keynote
of the whole book. It is so well established, however,
<!--File: cc336.pngPage 312-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_312" title="pg 312"></a>
that it ranks as a theory rather than as an hypothesis.
Next comes the hypothesis that variations in the solar
atmosphere influence the earth's climate chiefly by causing
variations not only in temperature but also in
atmospheric pressure and thus in storminess, wind, and
rainfall. This, too, is one of the essential foundations on
which the rest of the book is built, but though this
cyclonic hypothesis is still a matter of discussion, it
seems to be based on strong evidence. These two hypotheses
might lead us astray were they not balanced by
another. This other is that many climatic conditions are
due to purely terrestrial causes, such as the form and
altitude of the lands, the degree to which the continents
are united, the movement of ocean currents, the activity
of volcanoes, and the composition of the atmosphere and
the ocean. Only by combining the solar and the terrestrial
can the truth be perceived. Finally, the last main hypothesis
of this book holds that if the climatic conditions which
now prevail at times of solar activity were magnified
sufficiently and if they occurred in conjunction with certain
important terrestrial conditions of which there is
good evidence, they would produce most of the notable
phenomena of glacial periods. For example, they would
explain such puzzling conditions as the localization and
periodicity of glaciation, the formation of loess, and the
occurrence of glaciation in low latitudes during Permian
and Proterozoic times. The converse of this is that if
the conditions which now prevail at times when the sun
is relatively inactive should be intensified, that is, if
the sun's atmosphere should become calmer than now,
and if the proper terrestrial conditions of topographic
form and atmospheric composition should prevail, there
would arise the mild climatic conditions which appear
to have prevailed during the greater part of geological
<!--File: cc337.png Page 313-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_313" title="pg 313"></a>
time. In short, there seems thus far to be no phase of
the climate of the past which is not in harmony with an
hypothesis which combines into a single unit the three
main hypotheses of this book, solar, cyclonic, and terrestrial.</p>

<p>Outside the main line of thought lie several other
hypotheses. Several of these, as well as some of the main
hypotheses, are discussed chiefly in <em>Earth and Sun</em>, but
as they are given a practical application in this book
they deserve a place in this final summary. Each of these
secondary hypotheses is in its way important. Yet any or
all may prove untrue without altering our main conclusions.
This point cannot be too strongly emphasized, for
there is always danger that differences of opinion as to
minor hypotheses and even as to details may divert attention
from the main point. Among the non-essential
hypotheses is the idea that the sun's atmosphere influences
that of the earth electrically as well as thermally.
This idea is still so new that it has only just entered the
stage of active discussion, and naturally the weight of
opinion is against it. Although not necessary to the main
purpose of this book, it plays a minor r&ocirc;le in the chapter
dealing with the relation of the sun to other astronomical
bodies. It also has a vital bearing on the further advance
of the science of meteorology and the art of weather
forecasting. Another secondary hypothesis holds that
sunspots are set in motion by the planets. Whether the
effect is gravitational or more probably electrical, or
perhaps of some other sort, does not concern us at present,
although the weight of evidence seems to point
toward electronic emissions. This question, like that of
the relative parts played by heat and electricity in terrestrial
climatic changes, can be set aside for the moment.
What does concern us is a third hypothesis, namely, that
<!--File: cc338.png-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_314" title="pg 314"></a>
if the planets really determine the periodicity of sunspots,
even though not supplying the energy, the sun in
its flight through space must have been repeatedly and
more strongly influenced in the same way by many other
heavenly bodies. In that case, climatic changes like those
of the present, but sometimes greatly magnified, have presumably
arisen because of the constantly changing position
of the solar system in respect to other parts of the
universe. Finally, the fourth of our secondary hypotheses
postulates that at present the date of movements of the
earth's crust is often determined by the fact that storms
and other meteorological conditions keep changing the
load upon first one part of the earth's surface and then
upon another. Thus stresses that have accumulated in the
earth's isostatic shell during the preceding months are
released. In somewhat the same way epochs of extreme
storminess and rapid erosion in the past may possibly
have set the date for great movements of the earth's
crust. This hypothesis, like the other three in our secondary
or non-essential group, is still so new that only the
first steps have been taken in testing it. Yet it seems to
deserve careful study.</p>

<p>In testing all the hypotheses here discussed, primary
and secondary alike, the first necessity is a far greater
amount of quantitative work. In this book there has been
a constant attempt to subject every hypothesis to the test
of statistical facts of observation. Nevertheless, we have
been breaking so much new ground that in many cases
exact facts are not yet available, while in others they
can be properly investigated only by specialists in
physics, astronomy, or mathematics. In most cases the
next great step is to ascertain whether the forces here
called upon are actually great enough to produce the
observed results. Even though they act only as a means
<!--File: cc339.png Page 315-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_315" title="pg 315"></a>
of releasing the far greater forces due to the contraction
of the earth and the sun, they need to be rigidly tested
as to their ability to play even this minor r&ocirc;le. Still
another line of study that cries aloud for research is a
fuller comparison between earthquakes on the one hand
and meteorological conditions and the wandering of the
poles on the other. Finally, an extremely interesting and
hopeful quest is the determination of the positions and
movements of additional stars and other celestial bodies,
the faint and invisible as well as the bright, in order to
ascertain the probable magnitude of their influence upon
the sun and thus upon the earth at various times in the
past and in the future. Perhaps we are even now approaching
some star that will some day give rise to a
period of climatic stress like that of the fourteenth century,
or possibly to a glacial epoch. Or perhaps the variations
in others of the nearer stars as well as Alpha
Centauri may show a close relation to changes in the sun.</p>

<p>Throughout this volume we have endeavored to discover
new truth concerning the physical environment
that has molded the evolution of all life. We have seen
how delicate is the balance among the forces of nature,
even though they be of the most stupendous magnitude.
We have seen that a disturbance of this balance in one
of the heavenly bodies may lead to profound changes in
another far away. Yet during the billion years, more or
less, of which we have knowledge, there appears never
to have been a complete cataclysm involving the destruction
of all life. One star after another, if our hypothesis
is correct, has approached the solar system closely
enough to set the atmosphere of the sun in such commotion
that great changes of climate have occurred upon
the earth. Yet never has the solar system passed so close
to any other body or changed in any other way sufficiently
<!--File: cc340.png Page 316-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_316" title="pg 316"></a>
to blot out all living things. The effect of climatic
changes has always been to alter the environment and
therefore to destroy part of the life of a given time, but
with this there has invariably gone a stimulus to other
organic types. New adaptations have occurred, new lines
of evolutionary progress have been initiated, and the net
result has been greater organic diversity and richness.
Temporarily a great change of climate may seem to
retard evolution, but only for a moment as the geologist
counts time. Then it becomes evident that the march of
progress has actually been more rapid than usual. Thus
the main periods of climatic stress are the most conspicuous
milestones upon the upward path toward more varied
adaptation. The end of each such period of stress has
found the life of the world nearer to the high mentality
which reaches out to the utmost limits of space, of time,
and of thought in the search for some explanation of the
meaning of the universe. Each approach of the sun to
other bodies, if such be the cause of the major climatic
changes, has brought the organic world one step nearer
to the solution of the greatest of all problems,&mdash;the problem
of whether there is a psychic goal beyond the mental
goal toward which we are moving with ever accelerating
speed. Throughout the vast eons of geological time the
adjustment of force to force, of one body of matter to
another, and of the physical environment to the organic
response has been so delicate, and has tended so steadily
toward the one main line of mental progress that there
seems to be a purpose in it all. If the cosmic uniformity
of climate continues to prevail and if the uniformity is
varied by changes as stimulating as those of the past, the
imagination can scarcely picture the wonders of the
future. In the course of millions or even billions of years
the development of mind, and perhaps of soul, many excel
<!--File: cc341.png Page 317-->
<a class="pagenum break" id="Page_317" title="pg 317"></a>
that of today as far as the highest known type of mentality
excels the primitive plasma from which all life
appears to have arisen.</p>

<p>S. Arrhenius (Kosmische Physik, Vol. II, 1903, p. 503) carried out some
investigations on carbon dioxide which have had a pronounced effect on
later conclusions.</p>

<p>F. Frech adopted Arrhenius' idea and developed it in a paper entitled
Ueber die Klima-Aenderungen der Geologischen Vergangenheit. Compte
Rendu, Tenth (Mexico) Congr. Geol. Intern., 1907 (=1908), pp. 299-325.</p>

<p>The exact origin of the carbon dioxide theory has been stated so variously
that it seems worth while to give the exact facts. Prompted by the suggestion,
of Tyndall that glaciation might be due to depletion of atmospheric
carbon dioxide, Chamberlin worked up the essentials of his early views
before he saw any publication from Arrhenius, to whom the idea has often
been attributed. In 1895 or earlier Chamberlin began to give the carbon
dioxide hypothesis to his students and to discuss it before local scientific
bodies. In 1897 he prepared a paper on "A Group of Hypotheses Bearing
on Climatic Changes," Jour. Geol., Vol. V (1897), to be read at the meeting
of the British Association at Toronto, basing his conclusions on Tyndall's
determination of the competency of carbon dioxide as an absorber of heat
radiated from the earth. He had essentially completed this when a paper by
Arrhenius, "On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature
of the ground," Phil. Mag., 1896, pp. 237-276, first came to his
attention. Chamberlin then changed his conservative, tentative statement of
the functions of carbon dioxide to a more sweeping one based on Arrhenius'
very definite quantitative deductions from Langley's experiments. Both
Langley and Arrhenius were then in the ascendancy of their reputations
and seemingly higher authorities could scarcely have been chosen, nor a
finer combination than experiment and physico-mathematical development.
Arrhenius' deductions were later proved to have been overstrained, while
Langley's interpretation and even his observations were challenged. Chamberlin's
latest views are more like his earlier and more conservative statement.</p></div>

<div id="fn20"><p><a href="#r20">[20]</a> &nbsp; This is due to the fact that where these forests occur, in Gilead for
example, the mountains to the west break down, so that the west winds with
water from the Mediterranean are able to reach the inner range without
having lost all their water. It is one of the misfortunes of Syria that its
mountains generally rise so close to the sea that they shut off rainfall from
the interior and cause the rain to fall on slopes too steep for easy cultivation.</p></div>

<div id="fn104"><p><a href="#r104">[104]</a> &nbsp; Chamberlin, in a very suggestive article "On a possible reversal of
oceanic circulation" (Jour. of Geol., Vol. 14, pp. 363-373, 1906), discusses
the probable climatic consequences of a reversal in the direction of deep-sea
circulation. It is not wholly beyond the bounds of possibility that,
in the course of ages the increasing drainage of salt from the lands not
only by nature but by man's activities in agriculture and drainage, may
ultimately cause such a reversal by increasing the ocean's salinity until the
more saline tropical portion is heavier than the cooler but fresher subpolar
waters. If that should happen, Greenland, Antarctica, and the northern
shores of America and Asia would be warmed by the tropical heat which
had been transferred poleward beneath the surface of the ocean, without
loss <em>en route</em>. Subpolar regions, under such a condition of reversed deep-sea
circulation, might have a mild climate. Indeed, they might be among the
world's most favorable regions climatically.</p></div>

<div id="fn118"><p><a href="#r118">[118]</a> &nbsp; This fact is so important and at the same time so surprising to the
layman, that a quotation from The Electron Theory of Matter by O. W.
Richardson, 1914, pp. 326 and 334 is here added.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is a very familiar fact that when material bodies are heated they
emit electromagnetic radiations, in the form of thermal, luminous, and
actinic rays, in appreciable quantities. Such an effect is a natural consequence
of the electron and kinetic theories of matter. On the kinetic theory, temperature
is a measure of the violence of the motion of the ultimate particles;
and we have seen that on the electron theory, electromagnetic
radiation is a consequence of their acceleration. The calculation of this
emission from the standpoint of the electron theory alone is a very complex
problem which takes us deeply into the structure of matter and which has
probably not yet been satisfactorily resolved. Fortunately, we can find out
a great deal about these phenomena by the application of general principles
like the conservation of energy and the second law of thermodynamics
without considering special assumptions about the ultimate constitution
of matter. It is to be borne in mind that the emission under
consideration occurs at all temperatures although it is more marked the
higher the temperature.... The energy per unit volume, <em>in vacuo</em>, of the
radiation in equilibrium in an enclosure at the absolute temperature, T, is
equal to a universal constant, A, multiplied by the fourth power of the
absolute temperature. Since the intensity of the radiation is equal to the
energy per unit volume multiplied by the velocity of light, it follows that
the former must also be proportional to the fourth power of the absolute
temperature. Moreover, if E is the total emission from unit area of a
perfectly black body, we see from p. 330 that E=A&acute;T<sup>4</sup>, where A&acute; is a new
universal constant. This result is usually known as Stefan's Law. It was
suggested by Stefan in the inaccurate form that the total radiant energy
of emission from bodies varies as the fourth power of the absolute temperature,
as a generalization from the results of experiments. The credit for
showing that it is a consequence of the existence of radiation pressure
combined with the principles of thermodynamics is due to Bartoli and
Boltzmann."</p></blockquote></div>

<div id="fn134"><p><a href="#r134">[134]</a> &nbsp; In Table 8 the first column indicates the region; the second, the dates;
and the third, the number of shocks. The fourth column gives the month in
which the annual maximum occurs when the crude figures are smoothed by
the use of overlapping six-monthly means. In other words, the average for
each successive six months has been placed in the middle of the period.
Thus the average of January to June, inclusive, is placed between March
and April, that for February to July between April and May, and so on.
This method eliminates the minor fluctuations and also all periodicities
having a duration of less than a year. If there were no annual periodicity
the smoothing would result in practically the same figure for each month.
The column marked "Amplitude" gives the range from the highest month
to the lowest divided by the number of earthquakes and then corrected
according to Schuster's method which is well known to mathematicians,
but which is so confusing to the layman that it will not be described. Next,
in the column marked "Expected Amplitude," we have the amplitude that
would be expected if a series of numbers corresponding to the earthquake
numbers and having a similar range were arranged in accidental order
throughout the year. This also is calculated by Schuster's method in which
the expected amplitude is equal to the square root of "pi" divided by the
number of shocks. When the actual amplitude is four or more times the
expected amplitude, the probability that there is a real periodicity in the
observed phenomena becomes so great that we may regard it as practically
certain. If there is no periodicity the two are equal. The last column gives
the number of times by which the actual exceeds the expected amplitude,
and thus is a measure of the probability that earthquakes vary systematically
in a period of a year.</p></div>

<div id="fn136"><p><a href="#r136">[136]</a> &nbsp; The only other explanation that seems to have any standing is the
psychological hypothesis of Montessus de Ballore as given in Les Tremblements
de Terre. He attributes the apparent seasonal variation in earthquakes
to the fact that in winter people are within doors, and hence notice movements of the earth much more than in summer when they are out of
doors. There is a similar difference between people's habits in high latitudes
and low. Undoubtedly this does have a marked effect upon the degree
to which minor earthquake shocks are noticed. Nevertheless, de Ballore's
contention, as well as any other psychological explanation, is completely
upset by two facts: First, instrumental records show the same seasonal distribution
as do records based on direct observation, and instruments certainly
are not influenced by the seasons. Second, in some places, notably
China, as Drake has shown, the summer rather than the winter is very
decidedly the time when earthquakes are most frequent.</p></div>

<div id="fn137"><p><a href="#r137">[137]</a> &nbsp; A comparison of tropical hurricanes with earthquakes is interesting.
Taking all the hurricanes recorded in August, September, and October, from
1880 to 1899, and the corresponding earthquakes in Milne's catalogue, the
correlation coefficient between hurricanes and earthquakes is +0.236, with a
probable error of &plusmn;0.082, the month being used as the unit. This is not a
large correlation, yet when it is remembered that the hurricanes represent
only a small part of the atmospheric disturbances in any given month, it
suggests that with fuller data the correlation might be large.</p></div>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
